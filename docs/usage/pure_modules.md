# Pure Modules

A traditional robotics module subscribes to topics, keeps state on `self`,
and publishes from callbacks. It works — but the interesting logic ends up
welded to live infrastructure: you can't run it on yesterday's recording,
you can't unit-test it without a pub/sub bus, and two runs over the same
data won't reproduce the same behavior.

A `PureModule` splits the same job into three declarations:

- **when it runs** — one input marked `tick()` fires the ticks;
- **how every other input is sampled at that moment** — `latest()`,
  `interpolate()`, `window()`;
- **what it computes** — `step()`, a pure function of the aligned inputs.

```diagon mode=GraphDAG
camera -> align
pose -> align
imu -> align
align -> tick
tick -> step
step -> outputs
```

```results
┌──────┐┌────┐┌───┐
│camera││pose││imu│
└┬─────┘└┬───┘└┬──┘
┌▽───────▽─────▽┐
│align          │
└┬──────────────┘
┌▽───┐
│tick│
└┬───┘
┌▽───┐
│step│
└┬───┘
┌▽──────┐
│outputs│
└───────┘
```

Because `step` never touches ports, threads, or `self`, the same class runs
**live** on pub/sub ports and **offline** over stored
[memory2 streams](/dimos/memory2/intro.md) — and cannot tell the
difference. Replay, time-travel debugging, migration, and parallel
execution stop being features you build into a module and become
properties of the runtime.

This page walks through the offline experience, which is also how you
develop: record once, then iterate in a plain Python session.

## A tiny robot, recorded

Let's fabricate two seconds of robot data — in real life this is a
`SqliteStore` recorded on the robot, here an in-memory store is enough.
The camera runs at 10 fps, the pose at 25 Hz (driving +x at exactly
1 m/s), and the IMU at 100 Hz:

```python session=pure ansi=false no-result
import logging
logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)  # keep doc output clean

from dimos.memory2.store.memory import MemoryStore
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs.Pose import Pose

store = MemoryStore()
store.start()

camera = store.stream("camera", str)
pose = store.stream("pose", Pose)
imu = store.stream("imu", float)

for i in range(20):  # 10 fps, offset 5 ms from the pose clock
    camera.append(f"frame-{i:02d}", ts=0.005 + i * 0.1)

for i in range(51):  # 25 Hz, x = t because the robot drives 1 m/s
    t = i * 0.04
    pose.append(Pose(t, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), ts=t)

for i in range(201):  # 100 Hz
    imu.append(0.1 * (i % 5), ts=i * 0.01)
```

Notice the three streams don't share a clock — no two observations land on
the same timestamp. That's the reality pure modules are designed around.

## Your first pure module

The declaration reads top to bottom: tick on every camera frame,
interpolate the pose *to the frame's capture time*, batch all IMU samples
from the last 100 ms:

```python session=pure ansi=false
from dimos.core.stream import In, Out
from dimos.memory2.puremodule import PureModule, tick, interpolate, window

class Snapshot(PureModule):
    image: In[str] = tick()
    pose: In[Pose] = interpolate()
    imu: In[float] = window(0.1)

    described: Out[str]

    def step(self, image: str, pose: Pose, imu: list[float], ts: float) -> str:
        return f"{image} at x={pose.position.x:.3f}m with {len(imu)} imu samples"

out = Snapshot.over(image=camera, pose=pose, imu=imu)
for o in out.to_list()[:4]:
    print(f"t={o.ts:.3f}  {o.data}")
```

```results
t=0.005  frame-00 at x=0.005m with 1 imu samples
t=0.105  frame-01 at x=0.105m with 10 imu samples
t=0.205  frame-02 at x=0.205m with 10 imu samples
t=0.305  frame-03 at x=0.305m with 10 imu samples
```

Two things to notice:

- `step` parameters bind to the inputs **by name**, and the annotations
  are plain types — this is just a function. You can call
  `Snapshot.offline().step("f", Pose(1,0,0,0,0,0,1), [], 0.0)` in a test
  with no infrastructure at all.
- `x` equals the tick time exactly. The robot drives 1 m/s, so a pose
  *interpolated to the frame's capture time* must satisfy `x == t`. The
  25 Hz pose stream never sampled those instants — alignment built them.

`over()` returns a regular lazy stream: `.to_list()` runs it, `.save()`
persists it, filters slice it. Nothing executed until we asked.

## The sampler language

| Sampler | Value at tick time `t` |
|---|---|
| `tick()` | the observation that fired the tick |
| `latest(max_age=None)` | newest observation with `ts <= t` (hold), missing if stale |
| `interpolate(tolerance=0.5)` | lerp/slerp between the observations bracketing `t` |
| `window(seconds)` | every observation in `(t - seconds, t]`, as a list |

"At what state do we call the module" is always some combination of these.
Tick on poses with the latest image instead? Swap the samplers — the step
doesn't change shape:

```python session=pure ansi=false
from dimos.memory2.puremodule import latest

class PoseDriven(PureModule):
    pose: In[Pose] = tick()            # 25 ticks/s now
    image: In[str] = latest()          # most recent frame, whatever it is

    described: Out[str]

    def step(self, pose: Pose, image: str | None) -> str:
        return f"x={pose.position.x:.2f} sees {image or 'nothing yet'}"

rows = PoseDriven.over(pose=pose, image=camera).to_list()
print(rows[0].data)   # first tick precedes the first frame
print(rows[-1].data)
```

```results
x=0.00 sees nothing yet
x=2.00 sees frame-19
```

## When data is missing

The step's *type signature* is the policy. `image: str | None` above said
"missing is fine, give me None". A non-optional parameter instead **drops
the tick** — the module simply doesn't run without its required inputs:

```python session=pure ansi=false
gps = store.stream("gps", str)
for i in range(3):
    gps.append(f"fix-{i}", ts=i * 0.4)  # gps dies after t=0.8

class NeedsGps(PureModule):
    image: In[str] = tick()
    gps: In[str] = latest(max_age=0.5)  # a fix older than 0.5s is no fix

    described: Out[str]

    def step(self, image: str, gps: str) -> str:  # gps required
        return f"{image} located via {gps}"

located = NeedsGps.over(image=camera, gps=gps).to_list()
print(f"{located[-1].data}  <- last locatable frame")
print(f"{len(located)} of 20 frames located; the rest were dropped")
```

```results
frame-12 located via fix-2  <- last locatable frame
13 of 20 frames located; the rest were dropped
```

Offline, drops are summarized in a log line (and `over(_strict=True)`
raises instead — replay tests should fail loudly). Live, they're counted
per reason in the module's health stream.

## State, without `self`

Recurrent state (filters, gait phase, anything Kalman-shaped) is declared,
not hidden: name the first parameter `state` and return
`(new_state, output)`. Returning `None` as the output emits nothing — so
ticks double as filters:

```python session=pure ansi=false
class SpeedEstimator(PureModule):
    pose: In[Pose] = tick()
    speed: Out[float]

    initial_state = None  # (previous ts, previous x)

    def step(self, state, pose: Pose, ts: float):
        if state is None:
            return (ts, pose.position.x), None  # first tick: just remember
        prev_ts, prev_x = state
        v = (pose.position.x - prev_x) / (ts - prev_ts)
        return (ts, pose.position.x), v

speeds = SpeedEstimator.over(pose=pose)
values = [o.data for o in speeds.to_list()]
print(f"{len(values)} estimates, all {min(values):.2f}..{max(values):.2f} m/s")
```

```results
50 estimates, all 1.00..1.00 m/s
```

The runtime threads the state through the ticks. Because it's an explicit
value rather than attributes on `self`, a snapshot of it *is* the module's
full resume point — which is what makes restarts, migration, and
time-rewind mechanical.

## Modules compose like streams

A module's output stream is a normal memory2 stream, so modules chain into
pipelines — with stream operators slotting in between — and results save
back into the store next to the data they came from:

```python session=pure ansi=false
class SpeedAlert(PureModule):
    speed: In[float] = tick()
    alert: Out[str]

    def step(self, speed: float, ts: float) -> str | None:
        return f"speeding at t={ts:.2f}" if speed > 0.9 else None

alerts = SpeedAlert.over(speed=SpeedEstimator.over(pose=pose))

saved = store.stream("alerts", str)
alerts.save(saved).drain()
print(f"{saved.count()} alerts stored, e.g. {saved.last().data!r}")
```

```results
50 alerts stored, e.g. 'speeding at t=2.00'
```

The whole chain ran in one lazy pass: each pose tick flowed through
`SpeedEstimator`, became a speed, ticked `SpeedAlert`, and landed in the
store.

## The same class, live

Deployment is the part the module never sees. In a blueprint, each `In`
becomes a pub/sub port feeding a stream in the module's store, `step` runs
on a worker thread, and outputs publish to the `Out` ports:

```python skip
class Follower(PureModule):
    image: In[Image] = tick()
    pose: In[PoseStamped] = interpolate()
    cmd_vel: Out[Twist]

    backpressure = KeepLast()  # slow step? always process the freshest tick

    def step(self, image: Image, pose: PoseStamped) -> Twist:
        return chase(image, pose)

blueprint.add(Follower, expected_hz={"image": 30, "pose": 50}, min_output_hz=10)
```

Two deployment choices matter:

- **The store.** Default is a `NullStore` — inputs/outputs behave as
  live-only streams. Swap in a `SqliteStore` and the running module
  records every input and output as a side effect; develop against that
  recording with `over()` the next morning.
- **The backpressure policy.** `KeepLast()` (default) gives controller
  semantics: a slow step always sees the freshest tick and skipped ticks
  are *counted, not warned about* — for a 30 fps camera and a 100 ms
  step, dropping two thirds of ticks is the system working as designed.
  `Unbounded()` gives recorder semantics: never drop.

## Contracts, not log spam

Health is judged against declared contracts — input rates, output rate —
and reported as state transitions, not per-drop warnings. The monitor is
plain bookkeeping, so we can drive a fake deployment right here with a
fake clock:

```python session=pure ansi=false
from dimos.memory2.health import HealthMonitor

t = 0.0
monitor = HealthMonitor("follower", min_output_hz=10.0, warmup_s=0.0,
                        interval_s=1.0, clock=lambda: t)

for _ in range(3):  # a bad second: only 3 outputs against a 10 Hz contract
    monitor.on_step(duration_s=0.12, ages={}, emitted=True)
t += 1.0
health = monitor.maybe_report()
print(health.state, "-", health.violations[0])

for _ in range(15):  # a good second
    monitor.on_step(duration_s=0.05, ages={}, emitted=True)
t += 1.0
print(monitor.maybe_report().state)
```

```results
DEGRADED - output 3.0 Hz < contract 10 Hz
OK
```

Deployed, those same snapshots append to a `_health` stream in the module
store every second (drop rates by reason, step p50/p99, input staleness),
transitions log once with the violated contract, and a recording captures
the health stream *next to the data it explains* — so a post-incident
notebook can plot the drop ratio against the very frames that were
dropped.
