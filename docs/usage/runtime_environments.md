# Runtime Environments

Runtime environments let a blueprint choose how selected processes launch without making that choice part of the module class.

Use them when one module needs a different Python environment, when a Python project owns its own worker environment, or when a native module should get its executable settings from a named environment.

## Python venv workers

A Python module can run in a named Python environment while other modules stay in the default worker pool.

```python skip
from pathlib import Path

from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core.runtime_environment import PythonVenvRuntimeEnvironment

runtime = PythonVenvRuntimeEnvironment(
    name="sensors",
    python_executable=Path("/opt/dimos-sensors/.venv/bin/python"),
)

blueprint = (
    autoconnect(CameraModule.blueprint(), ConsumerModule.blueprint())
    .runtime_environments(runtime)
    .runtime_placements({CameraModule: "sensors"})
)
```

`CameraModule` runs in a worker launched by `/opt/dimos-sensors/.venv/bin/python`. `ConsumerModule` remains in the default Python worker pool. Modules in the same named environment share that environment's worker pool. Modules in different named environments never share a worker process.

The venv worker uses the same DimOS worker protocol as the default worker. Lifecycle calls, streams, module refs, and RPCs work the same way.

## Import-safe venv modules

The coordinator imports module classes before it launches workers. A venv-deployable module file must therefore be importable in the coordinator environment.

Follow these rules:

- Keep the module class at a top-level import path that exists in both the coordinator and worker environments.
- Do not import worker-only dependencies at module import time.
- Import worker-only dependencies inside `start()`, stream callbacks, RPC methods, or helper functions called by those methods.
- Avoid class-level annotations that require worker-only packages. The coordinator resolves annotations while it builds the blueprint.
- Install the module package and its worker-only dependencies into the named worker environment.

Minimal pattern:

```python skip
from dimos.core.core import rpc
from dimos.core.module import Module


class VenvOnlyModel(Module):
    @rpc
    def run_model(self, text: str) -> str:
        from worker_only_package import predict

        return predict(text)
```

The demo package at `packages/dimos-demo-worker-module/` follows this pattern. Its publisher imports a runtime helper only inside a worker-side RPC. The test `dimos/core/test_venv_module_demo.py` proves the coordinator can import and build the blueprint, while the placed worker runs the module through the named runtime environment.

## Python project workers

Use `PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment(name, project)` when the worker module lives in a separate Python project that should own project-local state.

```python skip
from pathlib import Path

from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core.runtime_environment import PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment

runtime = PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment(
    name="grasping",
    project=Path("packages/my-grasping-worker"),
)

blueprint = (
    autoconnect(GraspingModule.blueprint(), ConsumerModule.blueprint())
    .runtime_environments(runtime)
    .runtime_placements({GraspingModule: "grasping"})
)
```

The project directory must contain `pyproject.toml`. DimOS uses these conventions only:

- `.venv/` contains the uv-managed worker Python environment.
- `.pixi/` is optional Pixi state. If `pixi.toml` exists, DimOS treats the project as Pixi-backed.

Prepare project runtimes explicitly before running a blueprint:

```bash
dimos runtime prepare <blueprint>
dimos runtime prepare <blueprint> --runtime grasping
```

Preparation is blueprint-scoped and acts only on runtimes used by active module placements. Direct `PythonVenvRuntimeEnvironment` entries are externally managed no-ops.

`dimos run` is non-mutating. It does not install, sync, or update environments. If `.venv/bin/python` is missing, the run fails fast with a diagnostic telling you which `dimos runtime prepare` command to run. This is an existence-only staleness check: after changing `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `pixi.toml`, or `pixi.lock`, rerun `dimos runtime prepare` yourself.

Prepare commands run from the project directory on every invocation:

```bash
# uv-only project
uv venv --seed
uv sync

# Pixi-backed project
pixi install
pixi run uv venv -p .pixi/envs/default/bin/python --seed
pixi run uv sync
```

Worker launch also stays non-mutating:

- uv-only: `uv run --no-sync python -m dimos.core.coordination.venv_worker_entrypoint ...`
- Pixi-backed: `pixi run uv run --no-sync python -m dimos.core.coordination.venv_worker_entrypoint ...`

### GPD worker demo

`packages/dimos-gpd-worker-demo/` is an import-safe project-runtime demo. It pins `gpd @ git+https://github.com/TomCC7/gpd.git@c088d8ae2f7965b067e9a12b3c0dacdbe9da924a`, includes optional Pixi native build dependencies, and exposes `GpdImportProbe.import_gpd_core()`. The RPC lazily imports `gpd.core` inside the worker runtime and returns `gpd import ok: ...` on success.

Prepare the demo project when you want the optional integration to run:

```bash
cd packages/dimos-gpd-worker-demo
pixi install
pixi run uv venv -p .pixi/envs/default/bin/python --seed
pixi run uv sync
cd ../..
uv run pytest dimos/core/test_gpd_worker_demo.py -q
```

The same blueprint pattern can be prepared through `dimos runtime prepare <blueprint> --runtime dimos-gpd-worker-demo` if you expose the demo blueprint in a registry entry. Without a prepared `.venv`, the Pixi/GPD integration tests skip; import-safety and placement tests still run.

## Packaging convention

Place venv-deployable modules in their own Python package when they have a dependency closure that should not be installed in the coordinator environment.

Recommended layout:

```text
packages/my-venv-module/
├── pyproject.toml
└── src/my_venv_module/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── blueprint.py
```

The package's `pyproject.toml` should declare the worker dependencies needed by that module. The coordinator does not need those dependencies if the module imports them lazily.

Phase 1 packages may depend on the root `dimos` package. A future split can replace that with a smaller worker runtime package.

### Simulator runtime modules

Simulator integrations follow the project-worker pattern when their dependency
closure is too heavy or conflicting for the coordinator environment. The runtime
package exposes an import-safe `Module` class plus a package-local blueprint helper
that hides the placement boilerplate:

```python skip
from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core.runtime_environment import PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment

from my_sim_runtime.module import MySimRuntimeModule


def my_sim_runtime_blueprint(runtime: PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment | None = None):
    environment = runtime or PythonProjectRuntimeEnvironment(
        name="my-sim-runtime",
        project=Path("packages/my-sim-runtime"),
    )
    return (
        autoconnect(MySimRuntimeModule.blueprint())
        .runtime_environments(environment)
        .runtime_placements({MySimRuntimeModule: environment.name})
    )
```

The module boundary is DimOS-native:

- control plane: `describe`, `reset`, synchronous `step`, and `score` RPCs;
- data plane: typed streams such as `Out[Image]`, `Out[CameraInfo]`, motor state,
  and runtime events;
- simulator ownership: reset, step, render, and camera capture are marshalled onto
  the simulator owner thread when the backend has thread-affine render contexts.

Do not use a long-running HTTP server or `/payloads/{id}` image fetches as the
target runtime boundary. Those paths are migration removal gates once the placed
module path covers import boundaries, runtime preparation, control RPCs, typed
data streams, and benchmark parity.

## Native module runtime environments

Native modules can reference a named native runtime environment instead of repeating executable/build settings in every config.

```python skip
from pathlib import Path

from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core.native_module import NativeModuleConfig
from dimos.core.runtime_environment import NixNativeRuntimeEnvironment

native_env = NixNativeRuntimeEnvironment(
    name="mid360-native",
    executable="result/bin/mid360_native",
    build_command="nix build .#mid360_native",
    cwd=Path("cpp"),
    env={"RUST_BACKTRACE": "1"},
)

class Mid360Config(NativeModuleConfig):
    runtime_environment: str | None = "mid360-native"
    host_ip: str = "192.168.1.5"

blueprint = autoconnect(Mid360.blueprint()).runtime_environments(native_env)
```

Precedence is deterministic:

1. The runtime environment provides defaults for `executable`, `build_command`, `cwd`, and environment variables.
2. Non-`None` config values, including subclass defaults, override `executable`, `build_command`, and `cwd`.
3. `extra_env` overlays the runtime environment's environment variables.
4. Module-specific config fields still become CLI args as before.

Legacy native configs without `runtime_environment` continue to work.

## Current limits

- Venv workers run on the same machine as the coordinator.
- The venv must contain compatible DimOS worker runtime code. In phase 1, this usually means the venv can import the same source checkout or an equivalent installed `dimos` package.
- Direct `PythonVenvRuntimeEnvironment` entries are not created, installed, or synchronized by DimOS. Prepare those environments outside DimOS before running the blueprint.
- There is no remote deployment agent yet. Runtime environments only select local process launch material.
