# Runtime sidecars

DimOS benchmark runtime sidecars keep heavy simulator dependencies outside the
main DimOS environment while still exercising the real DimOS control path.

## Boundaries

- `packages/dimos-runtime-protocol` contains only Pydantic protocol schemas,
  compatibility checks, and codecs. It must not import `dimos`, Robosuite,
  LIBERO, or OmniGibson.
- Sidecar packages import `dimos_runtime_protocol` and their backend SDKs, but
  not the main `dimos` package.
- The remote runtime boundary is synchronous HTTP in this slice:
  `/health`, `/describe`, `/reset`, `/step`, `/score`, and referenced
  observation payloads under `/payloads/{id}`.
- The Robosuite sidecar intentionally serves HTTP requests on one thread.
  MuJoCo / Robosuite render contexts are thread-sensitive; keeping `reset`,
  `step`, offscreen camera payload capture, and the interactive viewer on the
  same server thread avoids corrupted camera frames in visual mode.
- The local motor data plane is OS shared memory between the DimOS runtime demo
  code and the `benchmark_runtime` `WholeBodyAdapter`. SHM is not the remote
  sidecar protocol.

## Fake runtime smoke demo

The fake demo requires no Robosuite installation and validates protocol,
sidecar startup, local SHM, `WholeBodyAdapter`, and real `ControlCoordinator`
wiring.

```bash
PYTHONPATH="packages/dimos-runtime-protocol/src" \
  uv run python scripts/benchmarks/demo_fake_runtime_sidecar.py
```

Expected output includes `"ok": true` and artifacts under
`artifacts/benchmark/fake-runtime-smoke/`.

## Robosuite Panda Lift plumbing demo

Run this from an environment that can import Robosuite 1.5.x and this monorepo.
The DimOS process still does not import Robosuite; the sidecar subprocess owns
Robosuite environment construction and stepping. Include the `manipulation` extra
when running demos that build `ManipulationModule`, because that module's default
planning backend uses Drake.

```bash
uv run --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_robosuite_panda_lift.py
```

To open the Robosuite viewer and watch the Panda receive a longer moving command
sequence:

```bash
uv run --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_robosuite_panda_lift.py --visual
```

The visual mode enables Robosuite's on-screen renderer in the sidecar process,
runs at least 600 ticks, and sends an oscillating joint-position command through
the same `ControlCoordinator` → SHM → runtime sidecar path. It requires a local
display/GUI-capable environment. Visual mode uses Robosuite/MuJoCo free-camera
viewer mode, so the viewport can be changed interactively with the viewer mouse
controls while the scripted motion runs. The named `agentview` camera is still
used for protocol observation metadata.

To verify the camera observation path through DimOS streams and Rerun, run:

```bash
uv run --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_robosuite_panda_lift.py --rerun
```

To verify the Robosuite camera payload path directly, without Rerun, run:

```bash
uv run --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_robosuite_camera_payload_smoke.py --ticks 2
```

This starts the Robosuite sidecar, receives real Robosuite camera observation
frames, fetches each referenced `.npy` payload twice, decodes it with NumPy, and
asserts that the decoded array matches the sidecar-computed source hashes,
shape, dtype, and pixel summaries. Results are written to
`artifacts/benchmark/robosuite-camera-payload-smoke/camera_payload_smoke_summary.json`.
The same fetched/decoded images are also written as JPEGs under
`artifacts/benchmark/robosuite-camera-payload-smoke/images/`: `_raw.jpg` files
are the exact received arrays, and `_display_flipud.jpg` files apply the current
OpenGL display flip hypothesis for side-by-side inspection.

If you need to verify the visualization transport independently of Robosuite,
run the deterministic color-bar smoke:

```bash
uv run python scripts/benchmarks/demo_rerun_color_smoke.py
```

The smoke script writes `artifacts/benchmark/rerun-color-smoke/color_smoke_summary.json`
and publishes a fixed RGB image through the same `.npy` decode, DimOS `Image`
LCM encode/decode, and Rerun bridge path. The expected display is top red,
middle green, bottom blue, with no color changes over time. If this smoke test
looks wrong, debug the DimOS/Rerun visualization path before debugging
Robosuite camera payloads.

`--rerun` keeps the Robosuite viewer optional. The sidecar returns `agentview`
observation frames with raw NumPy `.npy` payload references, the script fetches
those payloads from `/payloads/{id}`, decodes them, vertically flips Robosuite's
default OpenGL-convention images for normal image-display semantics, and
publishes a private demo `Image(format=RGB)` / `CameraInfo` stream pair through
DimOS transports. The Rerun bridge uses an isolated gRPC port and an isolated LCM
port by default, so repeated demo runs do not mix with older recordings or other
DimOS camera topics. The Rerun server/viewer memory cap defaults to `128MB`, and
image logging is throttled to `10Hz` to avoid unbounded raw-image memory use.
Override with `--rerun-memory-limit`, `--rerun-grpc-port`, `--rerun-lcm-port`, or
`--rerun-max-hz` when needed. When `--rerun` is enabled, the demo also writes
sampled fetched camera payloads as JPEGs under
`artifacts/benchmark/robosuite-panda-lift/images/`; `_raw.jpg` files are exact
decoded payload arrays and `_display.jpg` files apply the current display
transform. Control the sampling with `--camera-jpeg-dump-every N` (`1` dumps
every tick, `<=0` disables). Use `--visual --rerun` if you want both the simulator
viewer and the DimOS/Rerun stream view at the same time.

`agentview` is a scene/task camera, not a wrist camera. To inspect a wrist-mounted
Panda camera instead, run:

```bash
uv run --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_robosuite_panda_lift.py --rerun --camera-name robot0_eye_in_hand
```

Useful Robosuite camera names for this demo include `agentview`, `frontview`,
`sideview`, `birdview`, `robot0_robotview`, and `robot0_eye_in_hand`.

When `--visual --ticks N` is used, the script automatically raises the Robosuite
episode horizon to at least `N + 1`; otherwise long visual runs would hit the
default demo horizon and Robosuite would reject later `/step` calls after the env
terminates. You can still override this explicitly with `--horizon`.

The demo uses `dimos/benchmark/runtime/configs/robosuite_panda_lift.json`, starts
`dimos_robosuite_sidecar.server`, resolves the Panda motor surface, builds a
Robosuite `Lift` + `Panda` env with a `JOINT_POSITION` arm controller plus
`GRIP`, runs a scripted joint-position target through `ControlCoordinator`, and
writes artifacts under `artifacts/benchmark/robosuite-panda-lift/`.

If Robosuite is not installed, the script exits with an explicit sidecar health
failure and writes `robosuite_sidecar.log` with the import error.

## Agentic manipulation Robosuite validation

The agentic manipulation demo is a manual, script-hosted layer-2 validation. It
is not part of the default unit-test suite because it requires Robosuite and a
runtime sidecar process. The DimOS process still does not import Robosuite: the
script launches the Robosuite sidecar, resolves the runtime motor surface, builds
the local SHM bridge, then starts an in-script DimOS stack containing
`ControlCoordinator`, `ManipulationModule`, and `AgenticManipulationModule`.

```bash
uv run --extra manipulation --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_agentic_manipulation_robosuite.py
```

This command opens the Robosuite viewer by default so a human can watch the
primitive validation run. The visual defaults keep stepping long enough to make
the gripper open/close commands and joint motion observable. Use `--headless`
only for CI or non-GUI environments:

```bash
uv run --extra manipulation --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_agentic_manipulation_robosuite.py --headless
```

For a slightly longer manual check, run:

```bash
uv run --extra manipulation --with robosuite python scripts/benchmarks/demo_agentic_manipulation_robosuite.py --ticks 600 --horizon 700
```

The demo calls the universal agent-facing module API directly and fails hard if
`get_robot_state`, `open_gripper`, `close_gripper`, or a small safe
`move_to_joints` command does not report success. A background SHM-to-sidecar
stepping loop keeps simulator state moving while those blocking manipulation
calls execute.

The direct RPC calls are synchronous. `move_to_joints` returns only after the
trajectory task reports completion, while `open_gripper` and `close_gripper`
return after the command has been accepted by the coordinator/adapter. The demo
therefore keeps the sidecar stepping for `--primitive-pause-s` seconds after each
gripper command and `--post-demo-s` seconds after the joint move so the viewer
does not close before those actions are visible. If you override `--ticks`, make
it large enough for those pauses or reduce the pause durations.

Artifacts are written under the configured runtime artifact directory
(`artifacts/benchmark/robosuite-panda-lift/` by default), including the episode
config, runtime description, resolved runtime plan, derived runtime robot config,
stack summary, API call summary, motor trace, score when available, sidecar log,
and cleanup status. The script writes every artifact available even when the demo
fails partway through startup or API validation, so `api_call_summary.json`,
`motor_trace.json`, `failure.json`, and `cleanup_status.json` can be used to
diagnose partial runs.

The stack summary also records two script-local fallbacks. First, the
`HardwareComponent` is constructed directly as `WHOLE_BODY` because
`RobotConfig.to_hardware_component()` derives manipulator hardware, while the
benchmark runtime adapter exposes a whole-body SHM motor plane. The task and
robot model still derive from `RobotConfig`. Second, the script writes a minimal
runtime URDF with conservative joint limits because the current Robosuite sidecar
description does not yet provide authoritative planning model metadata.

`AgenticManipulationModule` itself is simulator-independent and imports only the
universal manipulation-control spec plus DimOS module/skill primitives. Robosuite
startup, runtime-plan resolution, SHM stepping, and artifact writing stay in this
script-hosted validation layer. MCP tool filtering, full LLM-agent execution,
Cartesian motion, and higher-level semantic manipulation skills remain future
work above this universal primitive facade.
