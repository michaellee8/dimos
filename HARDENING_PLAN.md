# Hosted Teleop — Issues & Execution Plan

Full-stack audit of hosted teleop (this repo + `dimos` robot side), 2026-07-01.
Companion to `BUG_AUDIT.md` (control-plane fix cycle, mostly ✅) — this file
covers what's still open across **safety, robustness, security, infra, and
video quality**, and how to execute the fixes.

**Legend:** severity `P0` (safety/security, do now) · `P1` (next) · `P2` (later/scale)
· effort `S` (<½ day) · `M` (1–2 days) · `L` (multi-day).
Repo tags: `[teleop]` = this repo, `[dimos]` = robot side.

Verified context that frames severity:

- The base-velocity path **already has a deadman**: every `move()` re-arms a
  200 ms auto-stop timer (`dimos/robot/unitree/connection.py:202`,
  `cmd_vel_timeout = 0.2`). Link drop while driving → base halts in ≤200 ms.
- The browser stamps twists in the robot's clock frame (clock-sync offset), and
  the robot drops stale (>0.5 s) / out-of-order twists
  (`hosted_connection.py:327`).

So the open safety work is about what the watchdog *doesn't* cover: frozen
video, in-flight sport actions, and truthful state after reconnect.

---

## Workstream A — Safety supervisor (P0)

Matches `dimos` roadmap Phases 2–3 (`myprojects/hosted/README.md`).

### A1. Wire the video-freshness drive lockout — `[teleop]` `S` — ✅ implemented
(auto-resume + neutral gate; liveness = video.currentTime progression, 1s
threshold; overlay + DRIVE pill + health=bad; one zero-twist on transition;
unit-tested in web/js/tests/stall.test.mjs. VR pose streaming not gated —
tracked separately.)
- **Issue:** The cockpit's `#video-lost` "video stalled — drive disabled"
  overlay (`web/js/views/go2.js:109`) is dead markup — nothing toggles it, and
  `state.driveEnabled` gates only on posture/E-STOP (`go2.js:420`). An operator
  can keep driving on a frozen last frame.
- **Plan:** Track video liveness in the 1 Hz tick: freshness =
  `framesDecoded` delta from `state.liveStats.video` (already sampled) or
  `video.currentTime` progression as fallback (covers LiveKit, which has no
  stats yet). If stale > N ms (start with 1000): show `#video-lost`, force
  `state.driveEnabled = false`, and have the keyboard loop emit one zero-twist
  before going quiet. Auto-clear when frames resume; require posture re-arm
  (press Stand/Drive) to resume drive.
- **Accept:** kill the robot-side video (leave datachannels up) → overlay
  appears ≤1.5 s, WASD stops sending, HUD health goes `bad`; frames resume →
  overlay clears, drive resumes only after Stand/Drive.

### A2. Robot-side E-STOP latch + stop-on-disconnect — `[dimos]` `M` — ✅ implemented
(estop/estop_clear message types + latch gating move() and commands; Damp on
the urgent path; providers inject synthetic operator_lost on both transports
→ stop_movement + nonce-cache reset + config-gated damp_on_operator_lost.
Browser E-STOP sends estop + legacy Damp; re-arm sends estop_clear.)
- **Issue:** No `estop` message type exists robot-side ("Damp" is just an
  allow-listed sport cmd). Browser E-STOP is fire-and-forget over the link —
  if the link is down it never arrives. Channel close is silent
  (`providers/broker.py:353`); an **in-flight sport action** (Jump/Pounce
  thread) runs to completion regardless of link state.
- **Plan:**
  1. Add `{type:"estop", nonce}` handled in `_on_state_json` *before* any
     dispatch: latch `self._estopped = True`, call `Damp`, ack. While latched,
     `move()` returns False and sport cmds are refused (ack `ok:false`,
     `reason:"estopped"`). Add `{type:"estop_clear"}` to re-arm.
  2. Stop-on-disconnect: in `BrokerProvider._heartbeat_once`, when
     `state_reliable`'s SCTP id transitions set→None (operator left), invoke a
     provider-level `on_operator_lost` callback; `Go2HostedConnection` wires it
     to `stop_movement()` + (config-gated) `Damp`. Mirror on LiveKit via
     `ParticipantDisconnected`.
  3. Surface `estopped` in telemetry (see A3) so the browser latch reflects
     robot truth, not local assumption.
- **Accept:** pull operator network mid-Jump → robot damps on operator-loss;
  E-STOP pressed with healthy link → ack ≤300 ms and subsequent WASD/actions
  refused until re-arm.

### A3. State snapshot on operator join + richer telemetry — `[dimos]` + `[teleop]` `M` — ✅ implemented
(robot_telemetry.state = {posture, rage, obstacle_avoidance, cams, estopped},
always published at 3Hz; cockpit reconciles via state.onRobotState, skipping
ticks with pending commands. Backward-compatible both directions.)
- **Issue:** `robot_telemetry` carries only `{cmd stats, soc, robot_ts}`
  (`hosted_connection.py:361`). Reconnecting operators get an optimistic UI:
  posture defaults to `StandReady`, obstacle-avoidance assumed ON, rage/cams
  unknown. (Cockpit `ui.posture`/`ui.obstacleAvoid` are local guesses.)
- **Plan:** Extend the 3 Hz telemetry payload with
  `state: {posture, rage, obstacle_avoidance, cams, estopped}` (robot-side
  authoritative values — `_rage_active`, `_cam_selected`, new estop latch,
  last-confirmed posture from the sport-cmd path). On the browser, seed
  `ui.*` from the first `robot_telemetry` after connect instead of constants,
  and reconcile on every message. This removes the need for a separate
  "greeting" message and survives missed packets (it's periodic).
- **Accept:** toggle OA / select Rage / sit the robot, hard-refresh the
  browser, reconnect → cockpit shows the true OA/rage/posture within 1 s.

## Workstream B — Robot-side hardening `[dimos]` (P1)

### B1. Bound command execution — `S` — ✅ implemented (single-worker executor)
(Repo-idiomatic single-worker ThreadPoolExecutor instead of a semaphore —
strict ordering; backlog >4 busy-rejects with ack ok=false; Damp/E-STOP
bypasses the queue on an urgent thread.)
- **Issue:** Every `sport_cmd`/`set_mode`/`obstacle_avoidance`/`StandReady`
  spawns an unbounded daemon thread (`hosted_connection.py:246,268,295,312`).
  Exposure is low (single authenticated operator, UI disables pending
  buttons), but a stuck RPC + spam stacks threads.
- **Plan:** One `threading.BoundedSemaphore(2)` around all runners; on
  contention ack `ok:false, reason:"busy"` immediately. Optional: serialize
  sport cmds through a single worker + queue(maxsize=1).

### B2. Nonce idempotency — `S` — ✅ implemented (10s TTL, cleared on operator_lost)
- **Issue:** `nonce` is echoed but never deduped (`hosted_connection.py:223`).
  Not a replay *vulnerability* (channel is DTLS-authenticated,
  ordered-reliable), but double-click/browser-retry double-executes.
- **Plan:** `deque(maxlen=64)` of seen nonces; duplicate → re-ack last result,
  don't re-execute.

### B3. `_rage_active` race — `S` — ✅ solved by B1's serialization
(check moved inside the single-worker task; B2 alone would NOT have fixed
this — the race was two *different* rapid commands, not duplicates.)
- **Issue:** Read in `_handle_set_mode` (line 280), written in the spawned
  thread (line 289), no lock — rapid toggles can double-fire `set_rage_mode`.
- **Plan:** Guard with a small `threading.Lock` (or fold into B1's
  serialization, which fixes it for free).

### B4. Stale watchdog comment — `S` — ✅ fixed
- `connection.py:201` says "Auto-stop after 0.5 seconds"; the constant is
  `cmd_vel_timeout = 0.2`. Fix the comment — it's the safety-critical number.

### B5. LiveKit heartbeat terminal condition — `S` — ✅ implemented (5-strike 401/404 stop)
- **Issue:** CF provider stops after 5 consecutive 401/404; LiveKit's loop
  (`livekit_broker.py:288`) retries/logs forever on revoked key/deleted
  session.
- **Plan:** Port the 5-strike terminal logic.

---

## Workstream C — Broker & deployment security `[teleop]` (P0/P1)

### C1. Network exposure — `S` **P0** — ✅ fixed (needs `terraform apply`)
- **Issue:** Security group opens **SSH 22** and **app 8450** to
  `0.0.0.0/0` (`terraform/main.tf`); `config.py:42` defaults
  `host="0.0.0.0"` (prod is safe only because systemd passes
  `--host 127.0.0.1`).
- **Plan:** Drop the 8450 ingress rule entirely (Caddy is the only public
  entry); restrict 22 to an admin CIDR var (or SSM Session Manager and drop
  22). Change `config.py` default to `127.0.0.1`.

### C2. Rate limiting — `M` **P1** (BUG_AUDIT N5) — ✅ shipped PASSIVE
(token buckets on keys-write / join+create / turn-credentials; dry buckets
log the would-be 429. Flip `RATE_LIMIT_ENFORCE=true` after a week of clean
logs. Tests: app/test_ratelimit.py.)
- **Issue:** No limits on `/keys` (mint), `/join`, `/turn-credentials`
  (TURN quota burn), auth-failure probing.
- **Plan:** `slowapi` (or a 20-line token bucket keyed on
  `owner_id|sub|IP`) at the router level: writes 10/min, TURN 6/min,
  heartbeats exempt. Return 429 with `Retry-After`.

### C3. Signup gating — `S` **P1** — ⏸ deferred by decision (2026-07-01)
- **Issue:** Cognito self-signup is open with auto-verified email
  (`terraform/cognito.tf`) — anyone can register and mint robot API keys.
  Tenant isolation contains them, but it's an open surface.
- **Plan:** Least effort: a Cognito **pre-signup Lambda** allowlisting
  `@dimensionalos.com` (+ invited domains); or flip to admin-create-only
  (`allow_admin_create_user_only`) while the pool is small.

### C4. CSP + token storage — `M` **P2** (BUG_AUDIT N1/N2, acknowledged) — ✅ CSP report-only + SRI shipped; enforce after validation; cookie auth still tracked
- **Plan (incremental, don't boil the ocean):** add
  `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` in the Caddyfile covering the known
  origins (self, `cdn.tailwindcss.com`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `esm.sh`,
  `fonts.g*`, Cognito endpoint, `wss:` for LiveKit), watch console for a week,
  then enforce. Pin the LiveKit script to an exact version + SRI hash and
  replace the Tailwind *runtime CDN* (explicitly not-for-production) with a
  built CSS file — that also removes the biggest inline-script obstacle to a
  strict CSP. httpOnly-cookie auth stays a separate tracked item (architectural).

### C5. DEPLOY.md Caddy drift — `S` **P1** — ✅ fixed (deploy.sh now ships web/ + Caddyfile too)
- **Issue:** DEPLOY.md Step 4 tells you to overwrite the Caddyfile with a bare
  `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8450` — that proxies *everything* to uvicorn and
  breaks static SPA serving, contradicting the committed `Caddyfile`.
- **Plan:** Replace Step 4 with "copy the repo `Caddyfile`" (single source of
  truth), and have `scripts/deploy.sh` rsync it + reload caddy.

---

## Workstream D — Scale & operability `[teleop]` (P2, plan now)

### D1. Single-instance SPOF — `L` — explain-only for now (decision 2026-07-01)

**What breaks today, concretely:**
1. **Broker restart kills live sessions.** `_robot_channel_ids` is in-memory;
   after a restart the robot's next heartbeat ack returns null channel ids →
   the robot closes its negotiated datachannels → teleop drops even though
   the CF session is still alive. Operator must re-join, sometimes the robot
   must re-create its session.
2. **`--workers >1` silently breaks.** Each uvicorn worker gets its own maps;
   the worker that served `bridge-datachannel` knows the ids, the worker that
   serves the robot's `heartbeat` doesn't → channels never open. Nothing
   errors; teleop just doesn't work.
3. **Instance death = full outage.** SQLite rides the instance; Litestream is
   one-way backup (minutes-fresh restore on re-pave), not failover. Recovery
   is manual: terraform re-pave + DNS wait.
4. **Capacity ceiling.** One t3.small handles the current fleet fine, but
   every robot heartbeats at 1 Hz — the ceiling arrives as latency on the
   session-setup path first.

**Why the plan's order fixes it cheaply:** moving the channel-id maps into
`TeleopSession` columns (step 2) alone fixes #1 and #2 — the heartbeat then
reads ids from the DB, so restarts and multiple workers become safe. Postgres
(step 3) fixes #3's data loss; the ALB pair (step 4) fixes #3's availability.
None of it changes the data plane — media/commands never touch the broker.
- **Issue:** One t3.small + SQLite; Litestream is one-way backup, not
  failover. Broker holds in-memory state (`_robot_channel_ids`,
  `_session_locks`, `_pending_video_renegotiations`,
  `routers/sessions.py:38-50`) so it cannot scale past one process — running
  uvicorn with `--workers >1` silently breaks channel-id delivery today.
- **Plan (ordered):**
  1. Guard: assert single-worker at startup (cheap insurance now).
  2. Move `_robot_channel_ids` + pending-renegotiation flags into
     `TeleopSession` columns (`state_back_channel_id` already lives there —
     finish the job; the maps are tiny and change at human cadence).
  3. Postgres via existing `DATABASE_URL`; swap per-session asyncio locks for
     row-level `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`.
  4. Then 2× instances behind an ALB + health checks; or, cheaper stopgap: an
     ASG of 1 with EIP re-attach for auto-recovery.
- **Accept:** kill -9 the broker mid-session → robot heartbeat re-learns
  channel ids from the replacement instance; drive resumes without robot
  restart.

### D2. Observability — `M` — ✅ /metrics shipped (loopback-only)
(bare prometheus_client: http counters/latency by route template, session
gauge via reaper tick, eviction + rate-limit-hit counters. Caddy does not
proxy /metrics, so scrape on-box. CloudWatch alarms remain a follow-up.)
- **Issue:** journald-only logs, no metrics, no alerting; `report.json` exists
  robot-side but nothing aggregates fleet health.
- **Plan:** `/metrics` (prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) + CloudWatch agent;
  alarms on: health-check fail, robot-heartbeat 5xx rate, reaper eviction
  spikes, disk >80 %. Log the per-session quality columns (`rtt_ms`, loss)
  on eviction for postmortems.

### D3. Terraform drift — `S`
- `ignore_changes = [ami, user_data]` means rotated CF/Cognito secrets in
  tfvars never reach the box. Move runtime secrets out of user_data into SSM
  Parameter Store (instance role already exists); `.env` rendered by a small
  fetch script at boot → rotation = restart, no re-pave.

---

## Workstream E — Video quality & frontend fixes (P1)

### E1. Codec/bitrate control on the robot track — `M/L` `[dimos]` — ✅ knobs shipped (opt-in)
(mux-level video_max_fps/video_max_width; BrokerConfig.video_codec preference
on aiortc; LiveKit TrackPublishOptions.video_encoding. Closed-loop bitrate
adaptation from operator video_stats remains the stretch follow-up.)
- **Issue:** aiortc defaults (VP8, source-rate, native resolution): no target
  bitrate, no degradation preference — congestion shows up as drops/freezes
  instead of graceful downscale. This is the single biggest lever on perceived
  latency.
- **Plan:** Prefer H.264 in the SDP munge; set encoder target bitrate
  (aiortc `RTCRtpSender.setParameters` / encoder config) from a blueprint knob;
  cap publish resolution/FPS in the mux (`_composite`). Stretch: close the
  loop — operator's `video_stats` (loss/freezes, already delivered to the
  robot) nudges the encoder bitrate up/down.

### E2. LiveKit HUD stats parity — `S/M` `[teleop]` — ✅ implemented
(stats sampler now takes a pluggable report source; LiveKit feeds the
subscribed track's RTCRtpReceiver.getStats(); shared delta math extracted to
statscore.js with node tests.)
- **Issue:** `startVideoStats` is skipped on LiveKit (`livekit.js:106`) — HUD
  video panel is blank, health classifier runs degraded.
- **Plan:** Sample the subscribed track's `RTCStatsReport` via the LiveKit SDK
  (`track.receiver.getStats()` or SDK stats events) and feed the same
  `video_stats` payload shape.

### E3. Verified frontend bugs (small, batch into one PR) — `S` `[teleop]` — ✅ fixed
1. **`videoStats` wedge:** `webrtc.js:385` — `if (dt <= 0) return;` leaks
   `inFlight = true` permanently (stats + e2e readout die for the session).
   Reset `inFlight` before that return.
2. **Stale battery/path across sessions:** `disconnect.js` resets
   `liveStats.{video,rttMs,offsetMs,cmdHz,cmd}` but not `soc` / `iceType` —
   next robot briefly shows the previous robot's battery and ICE path.
3. **`speedScale` mismatch:** `state.js:47` initializes `{lin:0.5, ang:0.5}`
   but `keyboard.js:120`'s comment claims the standalone keyboard view
   defaults to 1.0 (the `||` fallback never fires — object is truthy). The
   standalone view silently drives at half speed. Decide intended default;
   reset `state.speedScale` in `disconnect()`.
4. **Failed connect leaks loops:** `connect.js` catch paths navigate away
   without `stopKeyboardLoop()` / `stopTick()` — intervals survive (guards
   make them no-ops, but they stack across retries). Route failures through
   a `teardown()` that mirrors `disconnect()`'s local half.
5. **`setupLiveKit` re-entry:** no `setupInProgress` guard (unlike
   `setupWebRTC`) — double-click Connect can create two Rooms. Reuse the same
   flag.
6. **`op-heartbeat` overlap:** async `setInterval` without in-flight guard and
   `fetch` without timeout — a hung request stacks. Add the same in-flight
   bool used by `videoStats`.

## Execution order

| Phase | Items | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Now (P0)** | A1, C1, B4 | Highest safety-per-effort (A1 is browser-only), close the network exposure, fix the misleading safety comment. |
| **Sprint 1 (P1)** | A2, A3, E3 | Safety supervisor robot-side + truthful reconnect UI + the verified frontend bug batch (E3 rides along with A1/A3 UI work). |
| **Sprint 2 (P1)** | B1–B3, B5, C2, C3, C5, E2 | Hardening + limits + LiveKit parity. |
| **Later (P2)** | E1, C4, D1–D3 | Video pipeline upgrade, CSP/token migration, scale-out — start D1 planning when >~5 concurrent robots or first paying tenant. |

Cross-repo note: A2/A3/B* land in `dimos` (robot), A1/C*/D*/E2/E3 in
`dimensional-teleop`. A3 spans both — ship the robot-side telemetry extension
first (browser ignores unknown fields today, so it's backward-compatible),
then the UI seeding.

## Explicitly out of scope / already handled

- Operator-takeover TOCTOU, bridge partial-failure leaks, reaper coverage,
  JWKS refresh, setup timeouts — fixed; see `BUG_AUDIT.md` ✅ entries.
- Base-velocity deadman — **exists** (200 ms watchdog); do not re-report.
- Nonce "replay attack" — downgraded to idempotency nit (B2); channel is
  authenticated and ordered.
- `latency_stamp` per-frame copy cost — benchmark-only flag, default off.

## Demo issues (2026-07-01 field run)

Triage of the first real hosted-teleop demo. Evidence:
`dimos/logs/20260701-193746-teleop-hosted-go2-transport/main.jsonl` (main
36-min session) and the five runs after it (`201838`…`202831`), plus operator
browser console. Timeline (log times UTC = local+7): robot up 02:37:59,
operator joined 02:38:49, **stable drive for 36 min**, then 4 operator drops
in 2.5 min (03:15–03:17), blueprint restarts + one boot failure (03:23), dog
power cycle, final clean session 03:28→03:58.

### DM-1. Video black — dog firmware WebRTC peer wedged — `[hardware/ops]` **P0, root-caused; prevention open**
- **Symptom:** datachannels/telemetry/clock-sync all healthy, video never
  arrives ("renegotiation complete — awaiting frames", HUD 0fps). Blueprint
  and browser restarts don't help; **only a dog power cycle fixed it**.
- **Root cause:** the Go2 firmware holds ONE WebRTC peer. Dirty disconnects
  (crash/Ctrl-C during the earlier boot failures) left a zombie session; the
  firmware's video pipeline stayed bound to it while new sessions got
  lowstate/datachannels. MAX_BUNDLE proves it robot-side: video RTP shares
  the working datachannel transport, so "channels OK, video dead" ⇒ no
  frames fed, not network. The 03:23:15 boot `DataChannelTimeoutError`
  (`peer=connecting, ice=checking`) is the same zombie-slot family.
- **Broker-side confirmation (EC2 journal):** 5× `video: pull gave no offer
  errs=['empty_track_error']` across two sessions in the 03:20–03:24Z window —
  CF saw the track registered but **zero RTP behind it**. Independent proof
  the frames died robot-side, exactly matching the MAX_BUNDLE deduction.
  (`empty_track_error` ≠ the `not_found_track_error` propagation race the
  pull retry handles — no point retrying an empty track.)
- **Ops rule:** channels work but video black → power-cycle the dog first;
  also make sure no phone runs the Unitree app (it takes the slot).
- **Prevention (open):** (a) robot-side no-frames watchdog — no `color_image`
  for ~10s after local connect → log loudly + re-dial the dog link;
  (b) retry-with-backoff around `make_connection` (one 15s attempt currently
  kills the whole blueprint); (c) operator HUD banner "robot is sending no
  video" (distinct from the stall lockout) when fps=0 after renegotiation.

### DM-2. Operator session churn — 4 drops in 2.5 min — `[teleop broker/operator]` **P1, needs broker logs**
- **Evidence:** `operator link lost — stopping motion` at 03:15:10, 03:16:05,
  03:16:41, 03:17:27, each followed by a rejoin 10–25s later (fresh SCTP ids
  5/7 → 9/11 → 13/15 → 17/19; state_back re-pushed as id 2 every time).
  Matches the browser console: `[state-channel] closed` → new
  credentials+gather.
- **Working as designed:** the A2 stop-on-operator-lost fired on every drop
  (motion zeroed), and every rejoin re-bridged cleanly — the reconnect path
  held up in production.
- **Unknown:** WHY the drops. Hypotheses, most likely first: (1) operator
  reloading the page trying to fix the black video (drops cluster at the end,
  when the video fight started); (2) operator network blips >20s → reaper
  eviction; (3) CF session instability. **Next step:** broker journal for
  03:15–03:18Z — reaper evictions log `idle_for`, manual leaves log
  `user_initiated`/`pagehide`; that distinguishes all three.

### DM-3. RTT ~320 ms steady — `[network]` **P2, characterize**
- clock-sync RTT 315–336 ms for the entire session (offset 5–22 ms, stable —
  sync itself is healthy). If the operator was genuinely remote, this is the
  path; if near the robot, check the HUD Path row (TURN?) — a relay through a
  distant CF PoP would explain it. Drive feel at 320 ms: ~⅓ s-old video and
  similar command lag. E1 knobs (fps/width caps, codec) can trim encode/
  decode but not propagation.

### DM-4. Unclean shutdown when the dog link is dead — `[dimos]` **P2, small fix**
- **Evidence (run 202321):** `Exception in RPC handler for
  Go2HostedConnection/stop: Data channel is not open` (stop() → liedown over
  the dead local link) → `Error during worker shutdown`; plus recurring
  `Worker still alive after 5s, terminating` on other runs.
- **Fix:** best-effort-guard `liedown()`/`stop_movement()` in the stop path
  (log, don't raise) and bound local-link teardown so workers exit inside
  the 5s grace.

### DM-6. bridge-datachannel 410→502 residual — `[teleop broker]` **P2, one occurrence**
- **Evidence (EC2 journal):** 03:12:23Z `PUT …/datachannels/close → 410 Gone`
  then `POST …/52f62a90…/bridge-datachannel → 502`. The `adfcce2` fix maps
  CloudflareSessionGoneError to 409 only when `e.session_id` matches the
  stored robot/operator CF id — a 410 whose session id matches neither (or a
  CF error body that doesn't parse as session-gone) still falls through to
  the opaque 502. Self-heals (client re-provisions) but should be a 409 with
  a clear "re-provision" detail. Fix: widen the fallback in
  `_bridge_datachannel_locked` to treat any CloudflareSessionGoneError as
  409 + clear both stale CF ids.

### DM-5. ICE 701 console spam — `[teleop web]` **P3, cosmetic**
- `STUN/TURN … timed out` for the `:53` endpoints (DNS-port trick most
  networks eat) and IPv6 permutations (no v6 UDP path). Benign — the same
  gather logs `srflx×2 relay×10`. Option: log `:53`/IPv6 candidate-error
  permutations at debug, keep unexpected ones at warn.

### Non-issues confirmed during the demo
- **Negative clock offset** — offset is robot−operator; sign is arbitrary and
  every consumer applies it algebraically. Only instability or |error|→0.5s
  (stale-gate threshold) would matter; logs show 5–22 ms, steady.
- **A2/A3 in production:** operator-lost stop, telemetry state seeding, and
  rejoin bridging all behaved as designed across 5 drop/rejoin cycles.
