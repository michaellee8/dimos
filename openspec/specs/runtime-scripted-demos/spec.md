## Purpose

Define script-based runtime sidecar demos that validate protocol, motor-control, observation, visualization, artifact, and teardown plumbing without adding a new DimOS CLI command or requiring agent task success.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Fake sidecar smoke demo
The system SHALL include a script-based fake sidecar smoke demo that validates protocol handshake, prelaunch orchestration, resolved runtime plan generation, local motor bridge behavior, ControlCoordinator integration, and artifact output without requiring Robosuite.

#### Scenario: Fake demo completes in normal DimOS environment
- **WHEN** a developer runs the fake sidecar demo script in the normal DimOS development environment
- **THEN** the demo completes a configured number of ticks and writes episode config, resolved plan, protocol trace summary, motor trace, score output, and logs

#### Scenario: Fake demo exercises motor command/state flow
- **WHEN** the fake demo runs a scripted motor command sequence
- **THEN** commands flow from the ControlCoordinator-facing surface through the local bridge and protocol client, and motor states flow back into the DimOS side

### Requirement: Robosuite Panda Lift plumbing demo
The system SHALL include a script-based Robosuite Panda Lift plumbing demo that validates the real Robosuite sidecar, runtime description, derived motor mapping, network protocol, local motor bridge, observation stream export, score collection, and artifact output.

#### Scenario: Robosuite demo starts sidecar and DimOS blueprint
- **WHEN** a developer runs the Robosuite Panda Lift demo script with a compatible Robosuite sidecar environment
- **THEN** the script starts the sidecar, derives the resolved runtime plan from live sidecar metadata, starts the DimOS blueprint, runs the scripted sequence, collects artifacts, and tears down both runtimes

#### Scenario: Robosuite joint state changes from scripted command
- **WHEN** the Robosuite demo sends a scripted motor position command sequence
- **THEN** the returned Robosuite-derived motor state changes consistently with the command sequence and is recorded in the motor trace

#### Scenario: Robosuite observation stream is exported
- **WHEN** the Robosuite demo enables a camera observation stream
- **THEN** DimOS-side artifacts or logs show that at least one observation frame was received from the sidecar and published or recorded by the runtime client

#### Scenario: Robosuite camera appears in Rerun through DimOS streams
- **WHEN** a developer runs the Robosuite demo with Rerun stream visualization enabled
- **THEN** the demo fetches referenced `.npy` camera payloads, applies the declared image convention, publishes `color_image` and `camera_info` through DimOS streams, and Rerun displays the camera image through its normal stream bridge rather than through direct Rerun SDK logging at the runtime boundary

#### Scenario: Rerun demo stream is isolated and bounded
- **WHEN** a developer runs the Robosuite demo with Rerun stream visualization enabled repeatedly or alongside other DimOS publishers
- **THEN** the demo uses isolated Rerun and local DimOS transport settings for its visualization path and applies a bounded Rerun memory limit so old recordings or unrelated camera topics do not mix with the demo stream

### Requirement: LIBERO-PRO full-control runtime demo
The system SHALL include a script-based LIBERO-PRO runtime demo that validates the real LIBERO-PRO sidecar, runtime description, registered task reset, local SHM motor bridge, ControlCoordinator integration, camera payload export, score collection, artifact output, and teardown.

#### Scenario: LIBERO-PRO demo starts sidecar and DimOS control path
- **WHEN** a developer runs the LIBERO-PRO demo script with a compatible sidecar environment and prepared registered-suite assets
- **THEN** the script starts the sidecar, obtains runtime metadata, resolves the runtime plan, starts the DimOS control path, runs the configured tick loop, collects artifacts, and tears down both runtimes

#### Scenario: LIBERO-PRO demo exercises motor command and state flow
- **WHEN** the LIBERO-PRO demo sends scripted Panda motor position targets through the ControlCoordinator-facing path
- **THEN** commands flow through the local SHM motor bridge to the runtime protocol client, and sidecar-returned motor states flow back into the DimOS side and are recorded in the motor trace

#### Scenario: LIBERO-PRO camera payload is exported
- **WHEN** the LIBERO-PRO demo enables a configured camera observation stream
- **THEN** the demo fetches referenced `.npy` camera payloads and publishes or records at least one camera observation through the runtime observation path

#### Scenario: LIBERO-PRO score is recorded
- **WHEN** the LIBERO-PRO demo completes, times out, or reaches done
- **THEN** the demo requests sidecar-owned score output and writes success, reward or score, step count, task metadata, protocol trace summary, motor trace, and logs to the artifact directory

#### Scenario: LIBERO-PRO demo does not require agent task success
- **WHEN** the scripted LIBERO-PRO demo does not solve the selected task successfully
- **THEN** the demo can still pass if protocol, motor flow, observation flow, score collection, and teardown satisfy the demo acceptance checks

### Requirement: LIBERO-PRO asset preparation remains explicit
The LIBERO-PRO scripted demo SHALL NOT download or mutate benchmark assets unless the developer passes an explicit asset preparation flag or runs an explicit preparation command.

#### Scenario: Demo validates assets by default
- **WHEN** a developer runs the LIBERO-PRO demo without an asset preparation option
- **THEN** the demo validates prepared asset paths and fails clearly if required assets are missing

#### Scenario: Demo prepares assets only when requested
- **WHEN** a developer runs the LIBERO-PRO demo with an explicit asset preparation option
- **THEN** the demo may run the runtime asset bootstrap before launching the sidecar and still validates the prepared layout before episode reset

### Requirement: No agent success requirement
The scripted demos SHALL verify runtime plumbing and MUST NOT require an LLM, MCP skill policy, or successful task completion by an agent.

#### Scenario: Robosuite task is not solved
- **WHEN** the scripted Robosuite demo does not lift the object successfully
- **THEN** the demo can still pass if protocol, motor flow, observation flow, score collection, and teardown satisfy the demo acceptance checks

### Requirement: No DimOS CLI integration
The scripted demos SHALL be launched through plain scripts and MUST NOT require a new `dimos benchmark` command.

#### Scenario: Developer runs demo script directly
- **WHEN** a developer invokes the demo script with a config path
- **THEN** the script performs orchestration directly rather than delegating to a new DimOS CLI subcommand

### Requirement: LeRobot LIBERO policy rollout demo
The system SHALL include a script-based or module-backed LeRobot LIBERO policy rollout demo that validates policy loading, contract conversion, native runtime actions, sidecar stepping, score collection, artifact output, and teardown through the same module-backed policy evaluation path used by DimOS workflow.

#### Scenario: Policy rollout demo starts native sidecar and policy rollout stack
- **WHEN** a developer runs the LeRobot LIBERO policy rollout demo with compatible LeRobot dependencies and prepared LIBERO assets
- **THEN** the demo starts the LIBERO sidecar in native LIBERO action mode, initializes module-backed benchmark evaluation with a robot policy module, LeRobot backend, and VLA-JEPA LIBERO contract, runs the configured episode matrix, writes artifacts, and tears down all resources

#### Scenario: Policy rollout demo bypasses ControlCoordinator
- **WHEN** the LeRobot LIBERO policy rollout demo executes policy actions
- **THEN** actions flow from the robot policy module through benchmark evaluation to the runtime sidecar as native runtime action frames without using ControlCoordinator, JointTrajectoryTask, EndEffectorDeltaTrajectoryTask, the SHM motor bridge, or motor action frames

#### Scenario: Policy rollout demo enforces success gate
- **WHEN** the 50-episode policy rollout gate completes without setup or contract aborts
- **THEN** the demo passes only if the recorded success rate is greater than `0.50`

#### Scenario: Policy rollout demo records required artifacts
- **WHEN** the LeRobot LIBERO policy rollout demo runs
- **THEN** it writes rollout summary, per-episode JSONL records, runtime description, contract description, checkpoint metadata, logs, and cleanup status to the artifact directory

#### Scenario: Existing scripted demos remain unchanged
- **WHEN** the fake, Robosuite, or existing LIBERO-PRO motor demos are run
- **THEN** they continue to validate scripted runtime plumbing without requiring LeRobot policy dependencies or policy task success
