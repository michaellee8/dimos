"""Bare prometheus_client — the fastapi instrumentator pins a newer starlette
than fastapi 0.115 allows, and all we need is a registry + one middleware.

/metrics is intentionally NOT proxied by the Caddyfile, so it is reachable
only from the box (127.0.0.1:8450/metrics) — scrape it with an on-instance
agent (CloudWatch agent / node exporter sidecar), don't expose it publicly.
