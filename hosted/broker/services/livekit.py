"""LiveKit backend: room-scoped JWT minting.

LiveKit is its own SFU, so unlike the Cloudflare path the broker does no SDP
relay or datachannel bridging — it just mints access tokens and names the room
the robot and operator both join. The API key/secret stay server-side; only the
signed JWT (and the public server URL) reach clients.
