# DimOS Robotics Context

DimOS describes robots, actuators, control surfaces, and manipulation planning using precise robotics terminology. This glossary records stable domain language only, not implementation details.

## Language

**Planning group**:
A named subset of a robot model's joints and frames that can be selected as a planning unit.
_Avoid_: move group, joint group

**Composite planning group**:
A planning group that represents coordinated motion across multiple selected planning groups.
_Avoid_: group combination, combined groups, multi-group plan

**Auxiliary planning group**:
A planning group included in a planning request that may move as part of the plan but does not have its own task-space target in that plan.
_Avoid_: extra group, passive target group, unconstrained target

**Linear TCP path**:
A motion recipe where the tool center point follows a straight Cartesian segment from its start pose to its target pose within configured Cartesian tolerance.
_Avoid_: linear joint motion, linear motion

**Linear TCP trajectory smoothing**:
A manipulation-planning capability that makes a Linear TCP path executable without treating every intermediate Cartesian sample as a stop, while preserving Cartesian-line tolerance.
_Avoid_: waypoint skipping, making linear motion faster

**Adaptive-conservative smoothing**:
A trajectory smoothing policy that starts with an aggressive simplification and, on validation failure, preserves more of the original path rather than relaxing correctness tolerances.
_Avoid_: tolerance loosening, unsafe smoothing retry

**Trajectory post-processing pipeline**:
A staged manipulation-planning capability that may refine a geometric path, validate the refinement, assign timing, and apply execution-oriented smoothing while preserving the path's declared constraints.
_Avoid_: hidden waypoint hack, one-off retiming step

**Path-constraint metadata**:
Optional planning metadata attached to a geometric path that declares the path constraints any post-processing must preserve.
_Avoid_: planner debug data, visualization-only metadata

**Non-blocking smoothing fallback**:
A trajectory post-processing policy where smoothing failures fall back to the original geometric path rather than failing parametrization; the worst expected outcome is a slower valid trajectory.
_Avoid_: strict smoothing gate, smoothing-required parametrization

**Composite RoboPlan model**:
A RoboPlan-facing robot model that represents multiple registered robot models as one planning scene.
_Avoid_: combined URDF, merged robot scene

**Planning world**:
The authoritative belief state for manipulation planning, including robot state and scene state used by planners.
_Avoid_: planner context, backend instance

**Trajectory parametrization**:
The manipulation-planning capability that assigns time to a geometric joint path under motion constraints.
_Avoid_: trajectory generation, retiming when referring to the broader capability

**Generated trajectory**:
A manipulation-planning artifact that represents a geometric path after trajectory parametrization, ready for preview, validation, benchmarking, or execution planning.
_Avoid_: timed generated plan, generated plan when referring to the time-parametrized artifact, joint trajectory when referring to the manipulation-level artifact

**Shared trajectory time domain**:
The single timing basis a generated trajectory uses for all selected joints and robot-local projections in a composite or multi-robot motion.
_Avoid_: independent per-robot timing, per-arm retiming when referring to coordinated composite motion

**Trajectory dispatch**:
An execution-preparation artifact that derives control-task-specific joint trajectory messages from a generated trajectory without changing the generated trajectory's canonical global timing.
_Avoid_: generated trajectory projection, execution-time parametrization, per-task generated trajectory

**Policy trajectory dispatch**:
An execution-preparation artifact that derives control-task-specific joint trajectory messages from policy action chunks while leaving control authority with the configured control task.
_Avoid_: direct policy control, policy motor write, learned controller bypass

**Joint-trajectory policy chunk**:
A v1 robot-learning action chunk shaped to become the `JointTrajectory` argument accepted by a joint trajectory control task.
_Avoid_: generic policy action, direct motor command, backend-native tensor

**Contract-assigned trajectory timing**:
A v1 policy rollout convention where the robot policy contract assigns simple relative timing to backend action rows when constructing a joint trajectory for dispatch, starting the first action row at `time_from_start = 0`.
_Avoid_: controller-side chunk timing inference, untimed policy positions, trajectory parametrization

**Dispatch-owned trajectory timestamp**:
A policy rollout convention where the rollout module assigns the absolute intended start time for the whole contract-built trajectory chunk when submitting it to the control system.
_Avoid_: contract-owned dispatch time, backend inference timestamp as control timestamp, trajectory creation time

**Subchunk trajectory dispatch**:
A policy rollout convention where the rollout module generates a larger policy action chunk but dispatches only a configured leading subset of action rows to the joint trajectory control task before replanning.
_Avoid_: executing the entire policy horizon by default, deep policy command queue, hidden action-horizon truncation

**Completion-gated policy rollout**:
A simple rollout cadence where the policy module waits for the dispatched trajectory subset to finish before fetching the latest observations and generating the next backend action chunk.
_Avoid_: asynchronous continuous inference, speculative trajectory queueing, wall-clock-only rollout loop

**Sleep-gated policy rollout**:
A v1 completion-gated policy rollout implementation where the policy module waits for the expected row coverage duration of the dispatched trajectory subset using the rollout clock before fetching observations and replanning.
_Avoid_: task-completion dependency, signal-based rollout synchronization, speculative inference

**Policy action representation**:
The robot-learning action form a policy is trained or configured to produce before it is adapted for a DimOS control task.
_Avoid_: assuming all policy actions are joint positions, opaque policy output

_Avoid_: DimOS controller, ControlCoordinator task, policy output type

**Native LIBERO action mode**:
A LIBERO runtime mode, matching the official LeRobot LIBERO environment setup, that accepts the environment's own relative end-effector delta plus gripper action vector instead of a DimOS whole-body motor-position command.
_Avoid_: joint-position LIBERO profile, fake motor command, end-effector action as motor q

The policy-backend-specific action result that a robot policy contract converts into a robot-native policy action chunk.
_Avoid_: control command, joint trajectory, final actuator target

**Backend output envelope**:
A small rollout artifact that carries a backend-native action result together with inference metadata needed for validation, tracing, and contract conversion.
_Avoid_: policy action chunk, control command, backend internals leak

**Temporal sample readiness**:
The rollout-time check that the observation roles needed for a policy sample are available with acceptable freshness for the current inference tick, without requiring perfect cross-sensor timestamp equality.
_Avoid_: exact timestamp match, strict synchronization gate, semantic policy validation

**Contract conversion failure**:
