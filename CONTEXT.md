# DimOS Robotics Context

DimOS describes robots, actuators, control surfaces, and manipulation planning using precise robotics terminology. This glossary records stable domain language only, not implementation details.

## Language

**Composite RoboPlan model**:
A RoboPlan-facing robot model that represents multiple registered robot models as one planning scene.
_Avoid_: combined URDF, merged robot scene

**Planning world**:
The authoritative belief state for manipulation planning, including robot state and scene state used by planners.

**Coordinated simulation clock**:
A simulation benchmark clock policy where simulator time advances in lockstep with the DimOS control coordinator clock.
_Avoid_: autonomous simulator loop, write-triggered stepping, settle step

**Runtime sidecar**:
A separate process or environment that owns a benchmark simulator backend while DimOS owns orchestration, control integration, skills, and artifacts.
_Avoid_: plugin, embedded simulator

**Remote module worker**:
A separate Python environment that hosts first-class DimOS Modules while the main DimOS process owns blueprint orchestration and module coordination.
_Avoid_: arbitrary sidecar service, embedded optional dependency

**Venv module worker**:
A same-machine Python virtual environment that hosts first-class DimOS Modules separately from the main DimOS Python environment.
_Avoid_: remote deployment, sidecar service, optional dependency import guard

**Module import descriptor**:
A portable identity for a DimOS Module class that a venv module worker can import in its own Python environment.

A portable identity for the concrete Module implementation class that a venv module worker imports and instantiates for a module contract.
_Avoid_: coordinator-imported heavy class, pickled module class, alternate stream contract

_Avoid_: detection when referring to a persistent object reference

**Target-masked TSDF**:
A grasp-generation workspace representation where observations outside the selected Grasp target are suppressed with a deliberate cushion so the target remains intact.

**Target bounds**:
A world-frame axis-aligned bounding region used as a rough attention area for a Grasp target before grasp generation.
_Avoid_: perfect object geometry, grasp geometry

**SHM runtime data plane**:

A lightweight installable package in the monorepo that contains only remote runtime protocol schemas, codecs, and compatibility tests so sidecars can depend on it without installing DimOS.
_Avoid_: DimOS submodule, simulator backend package, hardware adapter package
