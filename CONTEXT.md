# DimOS Robotics Language

Shared vocabulary for DimOS robotics concepts. These terms define domain language, not implementation details.

## Language

**Robot Name**:
A stable planning-domain identity for a concrete robot/model instance, used in public planning group and flat joint-name scoping.
_Avoid_: World robot ID, hardware ID, namespace

**World Robot ID**:
An internal planning-world handle for a robot after it has been added to a backend world.
_Avoid_: Robot name, hardware ID, joint namespace

**Hardware ID**:
A control-layer routing identity for a hardware component. For manipulator robots, it normally matches the robot name at the coordinator boundary.
_Avoid_: Robot name when discussing planning semantics, world robot ID

**Planning Group**:
A named selectable serial kinematic chain of robot joints used as the unit of manipulation planning. After binding to a robot name, it is identified by a planning group ID and remains independent of backend world robot IDs.
_Avoid_: Move group, movegroup

**Planning Group Definition**:
The model-level declaration of a planning group before it is bound to a concrete robot in a planning world.
_Avoid_: Runtime group, robot ID

**End-Effector Association**:
Separate metadata used for pose-targeted operations. For a planning group defined by a chain, the end-effector link is the chain tip. For a planning group defined only by joints, there is no end-effector link.
_Avoid_: Planning group definition

**Planning Group Selection**:
The set of one or more planning groups chosen for a planning request.
_Avoid_: Composite group

**Planning Target Set**:
The atomic manipulation UI/planning state built on top of a planning group selection: selected planning groups, target authoring state, combined IK joint target, whole-set feasibility, and generated plan. Per-group UI panels are views into this target set, not independent planning states.
_Avoid_: Independent group cards, per-robot plan state

**Auxiliary Planning Group**:
A planning group selected to participate in a planning target set without receiving a direct end-effector pose target in that request. It is solved, checked, planned, previewed, and executed with the whole target set; it simply has no assigned target gizmo. A planning group may be auxiliary in one request and directly targeted in another.
_Avoid_: Joint-only group, intrinsic auxiliary group

**Coordinated Planning Problem**:
A planning request over one or more selected planning groups that is solved as one combined joint-space problem with one synchronized result.
_Avoid_: Batch planning, independent planning

**Planning Group ID**:
An API-level identifier for a planning group, always written as `{robot_name}/{group_name}`. `/` is reserved as the delimiter and is not part of either component.
_Avoid_: Bare group name, robot ID

**Default Planning Group**:
The generated fallback planning group used by robot-scoped compatibility APIs when no planning group is specified explicitly. It is not inferred from arbitrary SRDF group uniqueness.
_Avoid_: Unique planning group, primary planning group

**Robot-Scoped Compatibility API**:
A convenience API that accepts a robot name for common single-robot calls but immediately delegates to planning-group APIs through the robot's default planning group. It does not define a separate planning model, storage model, or groupless execution path.
_Avoid_: Robot-scoped planner, groupless API

**Joint State**:
A joint-name-keyed robot state that can represent any set of joints and is not inherently coupled to a robot, planning group, planning group selection, or joint-name scope. At flat multi-robot or coordinator boundaries, joint names are required and are global joint names. Robot identity and local-vs-global meaning are provided by the API boundary or containing type, not by extra fields on the generic joint state.
_Avoid_: Planning-group-scoped state

**Robot Model Joint Names**:
The ordered controllable joints of a robot model in the model's local namespace. This usually aligns with the model's actuated joints, but is not itself a planning group.
_Avoid_: Implicit planning group

**Local Model Joint Name**:
A joint name as it appears inside a robot model or SRDF before the model is bound to a concrete robot in a planning world.
_Avoid_: Runtime joint name, coordinator joint name

**Robot-Scoped Joint State**:
A single-robot joint state whose robot identity is explicit outside the generic joint state. Robot-scoped APIs may accept unnamed ordered joint vectors in robot model joint order; when joint names are present, they are local model joint names because the robot identity is already explicit.
_Avoid_: Namespaced local joint state, prefixed joint state

**Generated Plan**:
A flat planning result that may contain one or more robots. Joint states in a generated plan require names and use global joint names so the plan remains unambiguous across robot boundaries.
_Avoid_: Robot-scoped joint plan, local joint plan

**Group-Scoped Preview**:
A visualization request for a generated plan over a planning group or planning group selection. A visualization backend may render the whole robot when partial-group rendering is not practical, but the API scope remains the generated plan's selected planning groups.
_Avoid_: Robot-scoped preview API

**Global Joint Name**:
A boundary-level joint name that mechanically combines a robot name and local model joint name as `{robot_name}/{local_joint_name}` so it is stable and unique in flat joint-state representations, even when the local model joint name is already descriptive. `/` is reserved as the delimiter and is not part of either component.
_Avoid_: Resolved joint name, coordinator joint name, bare joint name, local joint name

**Robot Placement**:
The placement of a robot model within the planning world. Robot placement belongs in the robot model description rather than in a separate planning configuration transform.
_Avoid_: Planning base pose, config placement transform
