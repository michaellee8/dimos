# DimOS Robotics Context

DimOS describes robots, actuators, control surfaces, and manipulation planning using precise robotics terminology. This glossary records stable domain language only, not implementation details.

## Language

**Planning group**:
A named subset of a robot model's joints and frames that can be selected as a planning unit.
_Avoid_: move group, joint group

**Composite planning group**:
A planning group that represents coordinated motion across multiple selected planning groups.
_Avoid_: group combination, combined groups, multi-group plan

**Auxiliary planning group**:
A planning group included in a planning request that may move as part of the plan but does not have its own task-space target in that plan.
_Avoid_: extra group, passive target group, unconstrained target

**Linear TCP path**:
A motion recipe where the tool center point follows a straight Cartesian segment from its start pose to its target pose within configured Cartesian tolerance.
_Avoid_: linear joint motion, linear motion

**Linear TCP trajectory smoothing**:
A manipulation-planning capability that makes a Linear TCP path executable without treating every intermediate Cartesian sample as a stop, while preserving Cartesian-line tolerance.
_Avoid_: waypoint skipping, making linear motion faster

**Adaptive-conservative smoothing**:
A trajectory smoothing policy that starts with an aggressive simplification and, on validation failure, preserves more of the original path rather than relaxing correctness tolerances.
_Avoid_: tolerance loosening, unsafe smoothing retry

**Trajectory post-processing pipeline**:
A staged manipulation-planning capability that may refine a geometric path, validate the refinement, assign timing, and apply execution-oriented smoothing while preserving the path's declared constraints.
_Avoid_: hidden waypoint hack, one-off retiming step

**Path-constraint metadata**:
Optional planning metadata attached to a geometric path that declares the path constraints any post-processing must preserve.
_Avoid_: planner debug data, visualization-only metadata

**Non-blocking smoothing fallback**:
A trajectory post-processing policy where smoothing failures fall back to the original geometric path rather than failing parametrization; the worst expected outcome is a slower valid trajectory.
_Avoid_: strict smoothing gate, smoothing-required parametrization

**Composite RoboPlan model**:
A RoboPlan-facing robot model that represents multiple registered robot models as one planning scene.
_Avoid_: combined URDF, merged robot scene

**Planning world**:
The authoritative belief state for manipulation planning, including robot state and scene state used by planners.
_Avoid_: planner context, backend instance

**Trajectory parametrization**:
The manipulation-planning capability that assigns time to a geometric joint path under motion constraints.
_Avoid_: trajectory generation, retiming when referring to the broader capability

**Generated trajectory**:
A manipulation-planning artifact that represents a geometric path after trajectory parametrization, ready for preview, validation, benchmarking, or execution planning.
_Avoid_: timed generated plan, generated plan when referring to the time-parametrized artifact, joint trajectory when referring to the manipulation-level artifact

**Shared trajectory time domain**:
The single timing basis a generated trajectory uses for all selected joints and robot-local projections in a composite or multi-robot motion.
_Avoid_: independent per-robot timing, per-arm retiming when referring to coordinated composite motion

**Trajectory dispatch**:
An execution-preparation artifact that derives control-task-specific joint trajectory messages from a generated trajectory without changing the generated trajectory's canonical global timing.
_Avoid_: generated trajectory projection, execution-time parametrization, per-task generated trajectory

**Robokin kinematics backend**:
A DimOS kinematics backend that presents multiple robokin-supported inverse-kinematics engines through one robotics-facing capability.
_Avoid_: Oink backend, RoboKin world backend, single-engine Oink solver

**Robokin engine**:
A specific solver implementation selected inside the Robokin kinematics backend, such as Placo, Pyroki, or Oink.
_Avoid_: Robokin backend, world backend, planner backend

**RoboPlan kinematics backend**:
A DimOS kinematics backend implemented by RoboPlanWorld using RoboPlan-backed model state, planning groups, Jacobians, and collision state.
_Avoid_: Robokin backend, separate RoboPlan IK world, planner-only RoboPlan integration

**RoboPlan Oink IK solver**:
RoboPlan's task-based inverse-kinematics capability for solving one or more frame pose targets under joint constraints.
_Avoid_: hand-written Jacobian IK, Robokin-only Oink wrapper

A simulation benchmark clock policy where simulator time advances in lockstep with the DimOS control coordinator clock.
_Avoid_: autonomous simulator loop, write-triggered stepping, settle step

**Runtime sidecar**:
A separate process or environment that owns a benchmark simulator backend while DimOS owns orchestration, control integration, skills, and artifacts.
_Avoid_: plugin, embedded simulator

**Remote module worker**:
A separate Python environment that hosts first-class DimOS Modules while the main DimOS process owns blueprint orchestration and module coordination.
_Avoid_: arbitrary sidecar service, embedded optional dependency

A same-machine Python virtual environment that hosts first-class DimOS Modules separately from the main DimOS Python environment.
_Avoid_: remote deployment, sidecar service, optional dependency import guard

**Module import descriptor**:
A portable identity for a DimOS Module class that a venv module worker can import in its own Python environment.
_Avoid_: pickled module class, shared interpreter object, source checkout assumption

**Module placement**:
A blueprint-level decision that chooses where a DimOS Module instance runs, such as the default worker pool or a named venv module worker.

The coordinator-visible set of typed stream inputs and outputs a DimOS Module exposes for blueprint wiring.
_Avoid_: stream schema, port list, dynamic ports

**Follower-limit clamp**:
A teleoperation safety boundary where commands derived from a leader device are constrained to the follower robot's legal joint range before execution. Sender-side clamping improves teleop behavior, while downstream control and hardware layers may still clamp defensively.
_Avoid_: leader limit, calibration range clamp, normalization range

**Gripper endpoint calibration**:
A leader-gripper calibration step that records the raw positions corresponding to fully open and fully closed gripper states. It is distinct from arm-joint zero calibration because gripper control is based on an open/close interval rather than a neutral joint angle.
_Avoid_: arm range calibration, gripper zero pose, generic min/max dashboard

**Leader zero pose**:
The designed natural pose of a teleoperation leader arm that corresponds to the follower arm's all-zero joint configuration. Capturing this pose defines the leader's zero offsets for arm-joint teleoperation.
_Avoid_: arbitrary neutral pose, comfort pose, range calibration pose

**Leader joint assignment**:
The calibration-level association between a semantic leader joint name and the physical motor id that supplies that joint's reading. It is used when the physical motor ordering differs from the follower joint order.
_Avoid_: hardcoded wrist remap, runtime joint swap, follower joint alias

**Startup alignment**:
The operator responsibility to place a teleoperation follower near the leader-implied command before enabling live authority. It prevents first-command jumps when no automatic follower-state gate is present.

_Avoid_: optional module fallback, background retry policy, partial blueprint success

**Venv module placement API**:
A blueprint-level mapping that runs selected Python module contracts in named venvs using concrete module implementation descriptors.
_Avoid_: new Module base class, permanent class deployment attribute, global transport setting

**Runtime environment preparation**:
An explicit pre-run action that prepares only the runtime environments used by active module placements in a loaded blueprint configuration.
_Avoid_: implicit install during blueprint run, global environment-name command, preparing unused registry entries

**Python project runtime environment**:
A convention-driven runtime environment rooted at a Python project directory, where standard files such as `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and optionally `pixi.toml` determine how the worker Python environment is prepared and launched.
_Avoid_: per-tool runtime backend taxonomy, blueprint-embedded setup command, manually enumerated manifest paths

**Pixi-backed uv runtime**:
A Python project runtime environment where Pixi prepares the native/toolchain layer and provides the Python interpreter used to create the project-local uv `.venv`; worker launch uses the `.venv` Python with Pixi activation environment applied.
_Avoid_: Pixi-only Python environment, coordinator Python venv, launching without native activation environment

**Toolchain-mediated worker launch**:
A worker launch policy for convention-based Python project runtimes where DimOS invokes the project toolchain command, such as `pixi run uv run --no-sync python`, instead of reconstructing activation variables or launching the venv interpreter path directly.
_Avoid_: hand-built Pixi activation env, mutating sync during blueprint run, bypassing project runtime conventions

**Named runtime environment**:
A stable label in the runtime environment registry that modules and worker placements reference when they need a non-default execution environment.
_Avoid_: hardcoded venv path, Nix command string as identity, deployment type

**Named venv worker pool**:
A set of worker processes launched from the same named venv that may host multiple compatible placed Modules without mixing Modules assigned to other Python environments.
_Avoid_: one process per Module, shared cross-venv pool, global worker pool replacement

**Benchmark episode config**:
A backend-facing declaration of benchmark intent that names the task, robot, runtime constraints, and evaluation setup before any DimOS blueprint is launched.
_Avoid_: hardware config, simulator config, blueprint config

_Avoid_: backend SDK type, DimOS hardware adapter type, simulator object

**Runtime protocol package**:
A lightweight installable package in the monorepo that contains only remote runtime protocol schemas, codecs, and compatibility tests so sidecars can depend on it without installing DimOS.
_Avoid_: DimOS submodule, simulator backend package, hardware adapter package

**Runtime observation stream**:
A simulator-derived observation exposed through DimOS's normal typed stream contracts so visualization, agents, and evaluators can consume the same observation path.
_Avoid_: artifact-only observation, sidecar metadata, viewer shortcut

**Runtime payload reference**:
A protocol observation field that names retrievable binary observation data, allowing step responses to carry metadata while clients fetch image, depth, or segmentation payloads separately.

A visualization path where runtime observations are rendered by consumers of DimOS streams, not by calling a visualization SDK directly at the runtime boundary.
_Avoid_: direct Rerun log call, viewer-only proof, stream bypass

**Canonical demo camera topics**:
The first runtime camera visualization demo publishes a single RGB image and camera model on the conventional `color_image` and `camera_info` topics.
_Avoid_: demo-only topic namespace, artifact image, direct viewer entity

**Damiao-based Robot**:
A robot whose joints are actuated by one or more Damiao motors, possibly spread across multiple CAN buses and physical limbs.
_Avoid_: Damiao arm when the robot may contain multiple motor groups

**Damiao Joint Group**:
An ordered set of Damiao-driven joints that forms a meaningful physical group such as an arm, torso, or other controllable body section.
_Avoid_: Arm when the group is not necessarily an arm

**Damiao Bus**:
A named communication channel used by a Damiao-based Robot to reach one or more Damiao motors.

**Teleop adapter**:
A device-specific bridge from a human teleoperation source, such as a headset controller, phone, keyboard, or physical leader arm, into DimOS coordinator-facing command streams.
_Avoid_: teleop backend when the component emits coordinator command types, teleop module when referring only to the device adapter, controller when the device is not a robot controller

**Teleop profile**:
A configured teleoperation behavior that selects one primary way human intent drives robot motion while allowing secondary engagement, status, and diagnostic signals.
_Avoid_: backend when referring to behavior selection, mode when the distinction affects routing and safety semantics

**Primary motion output**:
The single motion-control path a teleoperation behavior uses to drive robot movement, so one human input source does not unintentionally command the same robot through multiple motion abstractions at once.
_Avoid_: all active outputs, debug stream, secondary status output

**Teleop command envelope**:
A small wrapper around a coordinator-facing teleoperation command that distinguishes an active command from no command and from an explicit stop command.
_Avoid_: using a missing command as a stop signal, overloading raw motion-message contents with teleop authority state
