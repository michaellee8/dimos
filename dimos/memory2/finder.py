"""Production version of the ``test_detect_objects_smart`` recipe.

Single-module variant that owns the memory2 SQLite store, embeds
images live with CLIP, and exposes ``find_object_3d(label)`` — runs
the chain ``.search → .near → QualityWindow → .map(vlm) →
Detection3DPC.from_2d`` to turn "find me a bottle" into a
world-frame 3D position.

Why one module instead of three (Recorder + SemanticSearch +
ObjectFinder3D): each ``MemoryModule`` instantiates its own
``SqliteStore`` with its own in-process ``SubjectNotifier``. Even
when they share a ``db_path``, ``stream.live()`` on one instance
doesn't see ``stream.append()`` on another — the notifier is
per-instance, not per-file. Collapsing the three concerns into one
module gives them one store, one notifier, and a working live
pipeline. (This is also why Lesh's ``unitree_go2_memory`` ships
only ``Recorder`` and runs ``SemanticSearch`` against pre-imported
recordings — live embedding wasn't unblocked yet.)
