"""Fixed constants, data paths, and the evaluation harness for the LIO
autoresearch experiment. This is the analog of nanochat-autoresearch's
prepare.py: it is READ-ONLY. It defines where the input data and ground truth
live, how to build the Point-LIO substrate, and — most importantly — the
ground-truth metric `evaluate()`. Do not modify this file; tuning happens in
algo.py.

The experiment: run Point-LIO (offline, on a recorded Go2 L1 lidar+IMU stream)
to produce an odometry trajectory, and score how well it agrees with the
robot's onboard leg-inertial odometry (`robot_odom`), which loop-closes to
~0.47 m over a 16.5 m path and is our rough ground truth.

METRIC (current): 2D (xy) absolute trajectory error vs ground truth, after a
rigid (rotation+translation, no scale) Umeyama alignment of the LIO frame onto
the odom frame. Lower is better. z is intentionally ignored for now: on this
flat single-story recording robot_odom's z is near-constant and uninformative.
When the stairs ("ankle killer") recording lands we will add 3D criteria
(measured height/range change at specific timesteps) — see evaluate_3d() below.
