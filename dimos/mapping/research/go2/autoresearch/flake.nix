    # GOTCHA: the rev pin below is load-bearing. To evaluate a flake input, Nix
    # copies that flake's source into the store, and the dimos worktree is ~100 G
    # (≈20 G tracked with smudged LFS, plus untracked junk) and usually dirty:
    #   - `path:../../../../..`        -> copies the whole 100 G tree. No.
    #   - bare `git+file:` (dirty tree) -> copies the smudged ~20 G working tree. No.
    #   - `git+file:...?rev=<sha>`      -> exports from git OBJECTS at that commit:
    #                                      LFS files are ~130 B pointers, untracked
    #                                      files don't exist. ~16 M closure, locks
    #                                      in <1 s. <- this.
    # Bump <sha> only when the root flake's dev shell changes (it rarely does).
    # Also note: this flake.nix must be `git add`ed — Nix won't see an untracked
    # flake file that lives inside a git repo.
