"""Post-process Go2 + Livox recordings: AprilTag-corrected groundtruth + .rrd.

Thin wrapper over dimos/mapping/recording/utils/post_process.py with the Go2
front-camera calibration and the lidar/odom pairs present in these recordings.

    uv run --no-sync python \
        dimos/mapping/recording/go2_mid360/post_process.py [TARGET] [--force]

TARGET may be a `mem2.db`, a recording dir containing one, or a dir to scan for
recordings. With no TARGET it processes the most recently created recording
under --recordings-dir.
