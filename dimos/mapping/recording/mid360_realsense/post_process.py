"""Post-process RealSense + Mid-360 recordings: AprilTag-corrected groundtruth + .rrd.

Thin wrapper over dimos/mapping/recording/utils/post_process.py. Intrinsics come
from the recorded RealSense camera_info; the camera_optical mount is fixed by the
record blueprint (1cm forward + 1cm below the lidar).

    uv run --no-sync python \
        dimos/mapping/recording/mid360_realsense/post_process.py [TARGET] [--force]

TARGET may be a `mem2.db`, a recording dir containing one, or a dir to scan for
recordings. With no TARGET it processes the most recently created recording
under --recordings-dir.
