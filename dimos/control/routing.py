"""Declarative stream-binding cards for control tasks.

Task manifests (``_registry.py``) stay import-free: they declare bindings as
plain strings, and ``ControlTaskRegistry`` converts them to the typed forms
here at load time. ``ControlCoordinator`` builds its stream route table from
them when tasks are registered.
