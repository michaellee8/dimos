"""Holonomic full-pose path follower (progress-indexed).

Tracks a poses-only Path where every waypoint carries a COMMANDED orientation
that may be decoupled from the travel direction (strafe through a tunnel while
facing along it). This is the capability the pursuit followers structurally
lack: RPP faces the travel direction, so it cannot honor a commanded yaw.

Control stack, per coordinator tick:

    Path (position + yaw per waypoint, no timing)
      -> ProgressPathReference: project the robot onto the path -> s_robot;
         reference pose = path interpolated at s_robot + lookahead
      -> speed regulator: cruise speed capped by the yaw-rate/curvature
         envelope ahead and a decel ramp into the goal, slew-limited
      -> feedforward (optional): reference spatial rates x path speed,
         rotated into the body frame
      -> feedback: per-axis P on pose error (world error rotated into the
         body frame by the current yaw), clamped — the same decoupled-SISO
         law as the trajectory tracker, gains derived from the plant fit
      -> command calibration: u_cmd = u_phys / K_plant (artifact), clamped
         to the measured envelope
      -> JointCommandOutput (VELOCITY)

The commanded yaw comes straight from the path — never re-derived from the
tangent; choosing orientations is the planner's job. Progress indexing makes
the reference robust by construction: no clock to desync at corners, and a
replan re-projects with no re-ramp from rest.
