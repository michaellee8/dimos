"""Lockstep tests for the module-level rolling-horizon refresh in
``RepulsiveFieldLocalPlanner._plan_needs_replan``.

The local planner caches its committed plan and only re-solves the (expensive)
Dijkstra on invalidation; between solves it re-emits the cached plan. The
*rolling-horizon refresh* re-solves when little of the committed plan remains
ahead of the robot, so the follower never runs out of lookahead and stalls
(a ~horizon-periodic stop-go that roughly halves effective speed on long
routes — the wp4 loop). These tests exercise the ACTUAL ``_plan_needs_replan``
method (via a duck-typed self, no framework machinery) rather than calling
``plan_path`` every tick the way ``test_dynamic_obstacles`` does, because the
stop-go lives in the caching loop, not in ``plan_path``.
