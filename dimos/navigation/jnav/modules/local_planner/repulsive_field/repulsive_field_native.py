"""Rust repulsive-field local planner (native module).

GENUINE high-rate solves: the Python module (kept as the reference
implementation in ``local_planner.py``) re-anchored a cached plan at 60 Hz but
re-SOLVED at only ~2-4 Hz, and grew stability machinery to survive that
latency. The Rust port solves fresh every tick and owns its costmap internally
(consumes ``terrain_map`` directly — no CostMapper module needed) at higher
resolution. Config field names mirror the Python configs; the measured
rationale for each value lives in the reference implementation's comments.
