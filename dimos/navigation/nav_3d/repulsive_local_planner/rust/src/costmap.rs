//! semantics in `dimos/mapping/pointclouds/occupancy.py` (height_cost with
//! `flag_dropoffs` + `reference_z`), self-contained so the local planner owns
//! its costmap (no CostMapper module) and can run it at high resolution.
//!
//! Layer chain (each rule carries the failure it was measured against, see the
//! Python file for the full history):
//!   1. band slice around the robot's storey (overhead + far-below removed)
//!   2. min/max height maps; pass-under only for true overhangs (mid-band empty)
//!   3. gradient cost (Sobel; can_climb scales height-change-per-cell to 0-100)
//!   4. drop-off layers: rim flags (fall > max_safe_fall), deep-void lethal
//!      (landing > void_depth_lethal below the band floor), GRADED shallow
//!      voids traversable (stairs descend riser-by-riser; ledges do not),
//!      unknown lethal except the ascent frontier / interior holes / graded
//!      shallow voids, below-band landing gap-fill (3x3 max, no-data cells only)
//!   5. chamfer distance transform to the lethal set (the solver's clearance
//!      field), cached with the grid.
