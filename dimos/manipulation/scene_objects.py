"""Resolve a *query* (an object id, or a world point a user clicked) into the
object's current world pose, blind to where that pose comes from.

This is the one seam that lets click-to-grasp run identically in sim and on the
real robot: the reach (``move_to_pose`` / ``pick``) is already source-blind — it
consumes a *pose*. We add a single resolver in front of it with swappable
sources:

    query ─► ObjectPoseSource.resolve(query) ─► ResolvedObject(object, world pose)
              ├─ PrivilegedObjectSource : the EntityStateBatch stream (sim ground truth)
              └─ PerceivedObjectSource  : a perception detection DB  (Phase 2; sim RGBD or real RealSense)

``ResolvedObject`` is the *un-streamed* form of one ``EntityStateBatch`` entry —
a ``SceneObject`` (§7-A identity + geometry, pose-less by design) paired with the
``PoseStamped`` it currently sits at. We deliberately do **not** fold the pose
into ``SceneObject`` itself: §7-A keeps that noun pose-less because pose lives in
the world / the stream, and that boundary is joint-agreed. This module is the
resolver only — it does not touch ``Obstacle`` / ``sync_entity_poses`` / the
WorldSpec backends.
