"""End-to-end harness: replay the Livox ``.db`` through the Rust FAST-LIO2 module
and check that the estimated trajectory stays physically plausible.

This is the regression test for the FAST-LIO2 divergence: on the recorded
``fastlio_stairwell_odom_divergence`` slice the pipeline currently blows the odometry up to
hundreds of meters within ~50s. The test asserts a bounded per-frame jump, so it
fails while the divergence is present and passes once the pipeline is fixed.

Marked ``tool`` because it needs the nix-built native binary and the LFS-hosted
recording, so it is excluded from the fast and slow CI lanes. Run it directly::

    uv run pytest dimos/hardware/sensors/lidar/rustlio2/rustlio2_test.py
