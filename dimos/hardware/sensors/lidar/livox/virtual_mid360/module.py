"""Python NativeModule wrapper for the virtual_mid360 Rust binary.

virtual_mid360 replays a recorded Livox Mid-360 pcap onto a virtual network
interface, rewriting packet timestamps to current-time and synthesizing the
Livox SDK2 control protocol so an unmodified consumer (e.g. PointLio) connects
to it as if it were a real sensor. It carries no dimos streams; it speaks the
Livox wire protocol over UDP, so consumers reach it by host_ip/lidar_ip, not by
stream wiring.

Usage::

    from dimos.hardware.sensors.lidar.livox.virtual_mid360.module import VirtualMid360
    from dimos.hardware.sensors.lidar.pointlio.module import PointLio
    from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect

    autoconnect(
        VirtualMid360.blueprint(pcap="/path/to/ruwik2.pcap"),
        PointLio.blueprint(),
    )
