"""Go2 L1 lidar extrinsic (base_link <- lidar) and camera mount.

The L1 is mounted nearly upside-down: raw lidar +z points at the floor. The
official Unitree config (go2_l1_lidar.yaml) encodes this as base->lidar
``[0.28216, 0, -0.02467, roll=0, pitch=2.88, yaw=0]`` plus a separate
``rotate_yaw_bias`` (~-123 deg, calibrated to the front-leg position). EXT_R below
is that flip, leveled to the averaged ground normal over several stationary windows
(floor tilt ~1-2 deg, floor below the robot) and yawed so the map heading matches
the trajectory. Validated against the official "default imu reading"
[yaw -57.9, pitch -8.1, roll -167.3] (agrees to a few degrees).
