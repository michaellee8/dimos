"""Static mount frames for the Go2 + Mid-360 + front-camera rig.

Published continuously onto tf while recording (see :class:`Go2Mid360StaticTf`) so the
mount geometry lands in the recording's tf stream.

The tree is rooted at ``world``, with identity ``world -> map -> odom`` edges.
Point-LIO runs with identity extrinsics: its odometry child frame IS the sensor
frame, so odometry supplies the moving ``odom -> mid360_link`` edge and the rest
of the robot hangs off it:

    world -> map -> odom -> mid360_link -> base_link -> front_camera -> camera_optical

Mount geometry (measured on the physical rig)
---------------------------------------------
- base_link -> front_camera: 32.7cm forward, ~4.3cm up (URDF front_camera mount).
- front_camera -> mid360_link: lidar is 3.2cm back, 12cm up, pitched 44 deg down
  and yawed -90 deg about its own z (the puck is mounted sideways).
- front_camera -> camera_optical: the standard ROS optical rotation (x-right, y-down,
  z-forward).

``mid360_link -> base_link`` is derived as the inverse of the composed mount
(base_link -> front_camera -> mid360_link) rather than measured directly.
