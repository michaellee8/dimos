"""Go2 tripod RL policy on REAL hardware via Go2WholeBodyConnection.

Real-hardware counterpart to [go2_tripod_sim]. Same RLPolicyTask, same
joint conventions, swap the sim MuJoCo adapter for the DDS-backed Unitree
connection.

Safety differences vs sim:
- RL task is `auto_start=False` and starts disarmed. Arm via
  `coordinator.set_activated(True)` RPC after the operator confirms the
  robot is in a stable stance.
- `activation_ramp_seconds=1.5` smoothly blends from the robot's pose at
  arming toward the policy's target over 1.5s, protecting against a lurch
  if the legs aren't at the default standing pose when armed.
- kp/kd match the training env (hip=20/1, thigh=20/1, calf=40/2) so the
  closed-loop dynamics match what the policy saw during PPO rollouts.

Usage:
    ROBOT_INTERFACE=eth0 dimos run go2-tripod-real

The robot will load the policy, hold safe-stop, and wait. To start walking,
either bring the robot to a tripod stance manually (or with Unitree's stand
command, then release sport mode) and arm via the coordinator RPC.

TODO (deferred): no built-in stand-up sequence yet. Operator is responsible
for putting the robot at a safe standing pose before arming. See
[data/notes/go2_rl_stand_gains.md] for the design notes on Unitree's
`_targetPos_1` (kp=50/kd=3.5) stand pose and the three-phase gain ramp
plan when we come back to this.
