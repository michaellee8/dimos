"""PCM → aiortc audio track for the Go2's speaker.

The dog's WebRTC connection negotiates ``m=audio sendrecv`` but never feeds the
outbound sender — this track fills that half. Push interleaved s16 PCM from any
thread; the dog-side PC pulls frames off ``recv()`` and Opus-encodes them.
Drain-mode (like ``CameraVideoTrack``): no frames pushed = nothing sent.
