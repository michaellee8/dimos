"""Unitree G1 GR00T WBC + Quest teleop + episode recording.

The full ``unitree-g1-groot-wbc`` stack (locomotion policy, nav, viewer,
``--simulation mujoco`` / ``--scene-package`` support) plus the Quest WebXR
retargeting module and the dimos.learning data-collection stack. Put on the
headset, open ``https://<host>:8443/teleop``, and:

    left stick        walk forward/back (+ yaw or strafe, see
                      ``right_stick_mode``)
    right stick       yaw (press = zero-Twist e-stop)
    both triggers     hold to track your hands with the robot's arms
                      (release: arms hold in place)
    B                 start / save an episode
    Y                 discard the in-progress episode

Wrist targets route to the ``dual_arm_ik`` coordinator task declared in
the groot blueprint (frame_id "dual_arm_ik/left|right"); locomotion goes
out as ``cmd_vel``.

Recording runs continuously into a timestamped session DB under
``~/.local/state/dimos/recordings/``; B/Y only place episode markers
(EpisodeMonitorModule). Off-sim, a RealSense provides ``color_image`` —
recorded for training and pushed into the headset as the operator's view.
The groot MuJoCo sim publishes no color camera, so sim sessions record
joints/commands only (point DataPrep's sync anchor at joint state, or
enable a sim color camera, if you need images from sim).

Export afterwards with ``dimos dataprep build`` — measured joint state,
the commanded wrist poses, and episode status are all in the DB, so
action semantics (next-state vs commanded) are a DataPrep config choice.

Usage:
    dimos --simulation mujoco --scene-package office run unitree-g1-teleop
    dimos run unitree-g1-teleop                      # real hardware
