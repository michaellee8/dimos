"""G1 arm teleop adapter.

Bridges the babylon viewer's ``HumanoidControlSpec`` to the
``ControlCoordinator``'s ``servo_arms`` task. The viewer's per-joint slider
HUD calls ``set_arm_joint(name, position)`` via RPC; this module owns the
14-joint arm target vector and publishes the full vector on the
``joint_command`` stream (transport-mapped to ``/g1/joint_command``) every
time. The ``servo_arms`` task expects a complete 14-vector target — its
contract is "give me a target, I'll hold it" — so the adapter is the place
that knows how to assemble that target from per-joint slider events.

The current target is seeded from the latest joint_state when the first
``set_arm_joint`` arrives (so we don't snap the other 13 joints away from
where they actually are). Subsequent calls mutate one slot and republish.

Joint names exposed to the viewer are the short form ("left_shoulder_pitch"),
matching the convention the babylon slider HUD uses. The ``g1/`` hardware-id
prefix is added internally when publishing, and stripped from incoming
joint_state names.
