"""Unitree G1 catalog entries for the manipulation stack.

Treats one G1 arm as a stationary 7-DOF manipulator rooted at
``torso_link``.  The G1 ``WHOLE_BODY`` HardwareComponent already
publishes joint state under dimos canonical names
(``g1/left_shoulder_pitch``, …) but the G1 URDF uses the upstream
Unitree names (``left_shoulder_pitch_joint``, …) — we expose
``joint_name_mapping`` so the manipulation module can translate
between the two.

Caveats:
- Base motion: IK assumes the torso is static.  The robot must not
  be walking while a manipulation trajectory executes.
- Gripper: the G1 hand is articulated (14 finger joints), not a
  binary gripper.  No gripper config attached.
