"""Ties the PimSim spec protocols to the concrete implementations.

The explicit ``class PimSimClient(SceneControl)`` / ``class DimSimClient(
SceneControl)`` declarations make the *type checker* verify conformance at the
class definition; these tests make *CI* verify it even where mypy is not run,
and pin the one protocol that is not yet satisfied so the gap is tracked rather
than buried in prose.
