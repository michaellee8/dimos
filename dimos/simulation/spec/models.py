"""Data contracts the PimSim protocols traffic in.

The nouns that exist today are re-exported from their real definitions so
there is a single source of truth and the protocols read against real types:

    EntityDescriptor   what an entity *is*  — stable identity + how to
                       instantiate: id, kind, mesh_ref, shape_hint + extents,
                       mass, rgba. No pose. (../entity.py)

    EntityStateBatch   where everything *is now* — a timestamped snapshot of
                       ``(EntityDescriptor, Pose)`` entries, restreamed every
                       tick; versioned length-prefixed JSON over LCM so
                       non-Python consumers decode it. (../entity.py)

    ScenePackage       what geometry *exists* — the cooked, portable scene
                       (visual GLB, decimated collision GLB, per-entity GLBs,
                       CoACD hulls, objects.json, MuJoCo wrapper MJCF). A
                       concrete dataclass, imported where you cook/resolve a
                       package. (dimos/simulation/scene/package.py)

``ScenePackage`` is deliberately NOT re-exported here — importing it pulls the
scene-asset cooking dependencies, which referencing the type should not
require. Import it directly from ``dimos.simulation.scene.package``.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SceneObject:
    """PROPOSED unified scene noun — the merge of planning's ``Obstacle`` and
    PimSim's ``EntityDescriptor`` into one type for "a shaped thing in the
    scene." Identity + geometry only; **no pose** (pose lives in the world via
    ``SceneObjectWorld``'s verbs and in the ``EntityStateBatch`` stream).

    It is structurally ``EntityDescriptor`` with ``entity_id`` renamed to
    ``object_id`` — which is exactly why the two collapse: they describe the
    same thing. Once merged, ``EntityStateBatch`` becomes a stream of
    ``(SceneObject, Pose)``, so the entity stream and the planning world share
    one vocabulary. The perception ``Object`` (``Detection3D``: pointcloud +
    mask + detector output) stays separate and is *converted into* a
    ``SceneObject`` by the obstacle monitor — it is observation, not spawnable
    geometry, and forcing it here would drag open3d + cv2 into the Rust/browser
    consumers.
