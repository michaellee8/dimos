"""PimSim protocols — the interface every simulator backend implements.

PimSim's thesis: make the *physics backend* a pluggable role so Dimos talks to
a simulator exactly the way it talks to real hardware — same topics, same
clients, same blueprint. Dimos never learns which backend (or whether it is a
sim at all) is on the other side.

Two backends exist today and **both implement the protocols below**:

    MujocoSimModule            headless, deterministic — the eval/CI authority
    BabylonSceneViewerModule   browser + Havok — interactive, high visual fidelity

A new simulator joins PimSim by implementing these — nothing else changes.

Three protocols, by role:

* ``PhysicsAuthority`` — the **backend**. Owns a scene + an embodiment, steps
  physics on its own clock, and publishes the authority-agnostic streams. This
  is the interface a new simulator must satisfy.
* ``EntityConsumer`` — anything that **reads** the scene stream (the planning
  world, the rust lidar, a splat camera, a mirror-mode viewer). Blind to the
  backend.
* ``SceneControl`` — the out-of-process **control client** (scripts, tests,
  evals) that authors and drives a scene the same way regardless of backend.
  ``PimSimClient`` and ``DimSimClient`` both implement it; an e2e test
  parametrizes over backends and the test body is byte-for-byte identical —
  which is exactly the "sim == hardware" property.

The data shapes these traffic in live in ``models.py`` / ``../entity.py`` /
``simulation/scene/package.py`` (``ScenePackage``): one description
(``SceneObject`` / ``EntityDescriptor``), one streaming snapshot
(``EntityStateBatch``), one portable package (``ScenePackage``).

    """A pluggable simulation backend — the interface a new simulator implements.

    A backend ingests a cooked ``ScenePackage`` and an embodiment at
    construction (from config, not via a call), steps physics on its own clock,
    and exposes the surface below. ``MujocoSimModule`` and
    ``BabylonSceneViewerModule`` both satisfy it; Havok and MuJoCo differ only in
    *which optional capabilities* they add (see below), never in this core.

    **Required of every backend** (the authority-agnostic contract Dimos binds
    to — identical to a real robot's topics):

    * ``entity_state_batch`` — a fresh snapshot of every scene entity
      (descriptor + world pose) published each tick. THE contract every
      consumer depends on.
    * ``odom`` — the embodiment's base pose in the world frame.
    * ``cmd_vel`` — the mobile-base velocity command the backend integrates.
      (Articulated/arm control flows through the ``ControlCoordinator``'s
      ``joint_command`` instead, which is likewise backend-blind — so it is not
      part of this protocol.)
    * ``authority_mode`` — ``OWNS`` (simulates, is the source of truth) or
      ``MIRROR`` (renders another authority's stream; a viewer, not a sim).
    * ``spawn_entity`` — inject a body at runtime beyond the cooked package.

    **Optional capabilities** (backend-dependent — declare via
    ``capabilities``; do NOT assume them):

    * RGBD / lidar / IMU sensors — ``MujocoSimModule`` publishes
      ``color_image`` / ``depth_image`` / ``camera_info`` / ``pointcloud`` /
      ``imu``; the Babylon viewer does not (splat/mesh cameras are *separate*
      ``EntityConsumer`` modules that composite the same stream).
    * Faster-than-realtime / determinism — MuJoCo headless; Babylon is locked to
      wall-clock for interactivity.

    A consumer must depend only on the required surface; reach for a capability
    only after checking ``capabilities``.

    ``PathFollower``, an agentic skill, ``SceneControl.cmd_vel``) drives the base
    by publishing ``/cmd_vel``; the authority is a pure consumer and is blind to
    which source wrote it. Arbitration is **last-writer-wins** by default — grab
    the keyboard and you override the planner; release and the planner's stream
    resumes. When a blueprint needs richer arbitration (teleop priority, deadman,
    ramping), it inserts a ``MovementManager`` that fuses the sources into the
    single ``/cmd_vel`` the authority consumes. A backend must NOT invent a
    private per-source channel it alone reads (the Babylon viewer historically
    integrated a ``/nav_cmd_vel`` only it subscribed to, so planner/teleop
    commands published on ``/cmd_vel`` silently never moved the sim) — that
    breaks source-blindness and the sim==hardware contract."""
