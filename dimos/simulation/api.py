"""PimSim — the usage API.

One facade for talking to a running PimSim, the same way you'd script a real
robot. Connect, place/move the robot, edit the scene:

    sim = PimSim()                 # connects to the running viewer + LCM bus
    sim.set_agent_position(1, 2)   # place the robot
    sim.cmd_vel(vx=0.5)            # drive it (open-loop velocity)
    sim.goto(10.9, 0.6)           # or send a nav goal (closed-loop)
    sim.add_wall(7, -2.5, 7, 3.5)  # author scene geometry
    sim.add_box((0, 1, 0.5))       # drop a collidable box

The robot itself comes from the **blueprint** you launched
(``dimos --simulation <mujoco|pimsim> --scene <name> run <blueprint>``); see
``add_robot`` for why adding one differs between backends.

This grows ``PimSimClient`` (the e2e ``SceneControl`` surface) into the full
API; the test fixture keeps working unchanged.

Backend note — every method here talks to whatever sim is running over the same
WS + LCM surface, so the *call* is backend-blind. The one place backends
genuinely differ is **adding a robot** (see ``add_robot`` / ``set_embodiment``).
