# Scene packages

A **scene package** is a robot-agnostic, self-contained directory holding
everything any DimOS simulator needs to load a 3D scene: visual mesh,
collision mesh, per-object semantic table, scene-only MuJoCo wrapper, and
a list of dynamic interactables. One source asset → one package → consumed
by **pimsim** (browser Havok) and **MuJoCo** with the same metadata. The
robot is attached at runtime via `MjSpec.attach()` inside
`MujocoSimModule.start`, so the package itself never carries the robot.

```text
~/.cache/dimos/scene_packages/<name>/
├── scene.meta.json                manifest — all paths relative to package root
├── browser/
│   ├── visual.glb                 gltfpack-optimised, static parts only
│   ├── collision.glb              decimated trimesh for browser raycasts
│   └── objects.json               per-prim semantic table (id, path, AABB)
├── entities/
│   └── <safe_id>/visual.glb       per-entity GLB in entity-local frame
└── mujoco/
    └── <key>/
        ├── wrapper.xml            scene-only MJCF (no robot include)
        └── *.obj                  cooked scene collision meshes
```

Packages are content-hash keyed on source mesh + alignment + sidecar +
schema. They do **not** depend on any specific robot; the same cooked
package binds to any robot the runtime attaches.

## Authoring a scene

Drop two files next to your source mesh:

```text
my_scene.glb                       # the source asset (USD/GLB/OBJ/PLY)
my_scene.cook.json                 # the cook sidecar (optional but recommended)
```

A minimal `cook.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://dimensional.dev/schemas/dimos/scene-cook-sidecar.v1.json",
  "collision": {
    "prim_overrides": {
      "Floor": {"type": "plane"}
    }
  },
  "interactables": []
}
```

Without a sidecar the cooker still works — you get an entity-free
package with auto-fit collision.

## Interactables

Two flavours, both expressed in `interactables[]`:

### Extracted from the source mesh

For chairs, fridges, printers — anything already modelled in the
source asset that you want as a dynamic body. The cooker matches
`source_prim_paths` with `fnmatch` against USD prim paths and GLB node
names, splits the matched prims out of the static bake, and emits a
per-entity GLB.

```json
{
  "id": "office_chair_001",
  "source_prim_paths": ["Chair.001_*"],
  "kind": "dynamic",
  "mass": 8.0,
  "physics": {"shape": "mesh"},
  "tags": ["chair", "office", "movable"]
}
```

### Synthetic

For props that aren't in the source mesh — manipulation cubes, test
markers, placed obstacles. No prim matching; geometry comes from
`physics.shape` + `physics.extents`, pose is explicit.

```json
{
  "id": "manip_cube",
  "pose": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.75, "z": 0.69},
  "kind": "dynamic",
  "mass": 0.15,
  "physics": {
    "shape": "box",
    "extents": [0.08, 0.08, 0.08],
    "friction": [1.0, 0.1, 0.001]
  },
  "visual": {"rgba": [0.85, 0.20, 0.20, 1.0]},
  "tags": ["manipulation"]
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Stable, used as `entity:<id>` MuJoCo body name |
| `source_prim_paths` | one of | `fnmatch` globs against USD paths / GLB nodes — extracted entity |
| `pose` | one of | `{x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz}` — synthetic entity |
| `kind` | – | `"dynamic"` (freejoint+mass), `"kinematic"` (RPC-driven), `"static"` (welded). Default `"dynamic"` |
| `mass` | – | kg. 0 forces kinematic. Default 1.0 |
| `physics.shape` | – | `"mesh"` \| `"box"` \| `"sphere"` \| `"cylinder"`. Default `"box"` |
| `physics.extents` | for synthetic | Half-extents triple for box, `[radius]` for sphere, `[radius, half_height]` for cylinder |
| `physics.friction` | – | Scalar sliding or `[slide, torsional, rolling]`. Default `[0.3, 0.05, 0.001]` |
| `visual.rgba` | – | `[r, g, b, a]` 0–1 — colour in both pimsim and MuJoCo |
| `remove_from_static` | – | Strip matched prims from the static bake. Default true |
| `spawn` | – | `"initial"` (in world at boot) or `"manual"` (only via RPC). Default `"initial"` |
| `tags` | – | Free-form labels — semantic queries |

### Collision policy overrides

The `collision` block under the sidecar is the same schema as the
older `<scene>.collision.json` file. Most useful keys:

```json
{
  "collision": {
    "default": "auto",
    "prim_overrides": {
      "Floor":           {"type": "plane"},
      "Wall_*":          {"type": "box"},
      "Curtain_*":       {"type": "skip"},
      "Stairs_*":        {"type": "decompose", "max_hulls": 16},
      "FlatPanel_*":     {"type": "hull"}
    }
  }
}
```

Per-pattern `type` values: `"auto"` | `"box"` | `"sphere"` |
`"cylinder"` | `"capsule"` | `"plane"` | `"hull"` | `"mesh"` |
`"decompose"` | `"skip"`. See `dimos/simulation/mujoco/collision_spec.py`
for the full reference.

## Cooking

```bash
python -m dimos.simulation.scene_assets.cook \
    path/to/my_scene.glb \
    --output-dir=~/.cache/dimos/scene_packages/my_scene
```

The cooker is **strictly robot-agnostic** — no `--robot-mjcf` flag, no
robot bundled into the package. `--rebake` ignores caches and rebuilds
from scratch. The cooker auto-discovers `<scene>.cook.json` next to the
source. Content-hash cached on source bytes + sidecar JSON + alignment
+ schema version — change any of those and a fresh cache directory is
created automatically.

## Dropping in a new robot

There is no "drop in a new robot" step for the cooker — every cooked
scene package already supports every robot. The runtime composer
attaches the robot when the sim module starts:

```python
from dimos.simulation.engines.mujoco_sim_module import MujocoSimModule
from dimos.simulation.scenes.catalog import resolve_scene_package

pkg = resolve_scene_package("dimos-office")

MujocoSimModule.blueprint(
    scene_xml=str(pkg.mujoco_scene_path),    # cooked scene-only wrapper
    robot_mjcf="path/to/go2.xml",            # any robot MJCF
    robot_meshdir="path/to/go2/assets",      # robot's mesh directory
    robot_id="",                             # body-name prefix (empty for single-robot)
    scene_entities=pkg.entities,             # chairs, props, etc.
    spawn_xy=(0.0, 0.0),
    spawn_z=0.06,
)
```

At start time `MujocoSimModule._compose_model` does:

1. Load the cooked scene wrapper into an `MjSpec`.
2. Add scene-package entities as bodies on `spec.worldbody` (entities
   with `kind="dynamic"` get a freejoint; static ones are welded).
3. Load the robot's MJCF into a separate `MjSpec`, setting its
   `meshdir` so menagerie robots find their STLs.
4. `spec_scene.attach(spec_robot, prefix=robot_id, frame=spawn_frame)`.
5. `spec_scene.compile()` → one `MjModel` with scene + robot + entities.

For multi-robot scenes, call `attach()` once per robot with distinct
`prefix` values to namespace body / joint / actuator / sensor names.

### What the robot MJCF must not have

- **No scene geometry.** No floor planes, walls, furniture. The scene
  package owns that.
- **No manipulation rigs.** No hardcoded `manip_*` bodies or tables.
  Author those as synthetic interactables in the scene's `cook.json`
  instead — they then spawn into pimsim and MuJoCo from one source.
- **No external `<include>`s outside its own directory tree.** `MjSpec`
  resolves the robot's includes relative to its own location.

## Consuming a package at runtime

### From a Python blueprint (MuJoCo backend)

See the snippet above. The cooker hands you a `ScenePackage` whose
`mujoco_scene_path` is a robot-free wrapper XML; everything else
(`entities`, `objects_path`, `visual_path`, …) is robot-agnostic too.

### Topics published by either simulator

| Topic | Type | Producer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/odom` | `PoseStamped` | sim | robot base pose |
| `/cmd_vel` | `Twist` | controller | drive command (sim subscribes) |
| `/coordinator/joint_state` | `JointState` | coordinator | sim writes via SHM, coordinator publishes |
| `/entity_state_batch` | `EntityStateBatch` | physics authority | **same wire format from MuJoCo and pimsim** — consumers don't care |
| `/lidar` | `PointCloud2` | rust `scene_lidar` | raycast over `browser/collision.glb` + dynamic entities |

The "physics authority" is whichever sim is wired in the blueprint —
MuJoCo for G1 whole-body, pimsim Havok for navigation-only flows. The
*other* one mirrors the published states as kinematic bodies for
rendering.

## What a `scene.meta.json` entity entry looks like

```json
{
  "id": "office_chair_001",
  "tags": ["chair", "office", "movable"],
  "source_prim_paths": ["Chair.001_*"],
  "matched_prim_paths": ["Chair.001_Mesh.030", "Chair.001_Mesh.030_1"],
  "visual_node_patterns": ["Chair.001"],
  "remove_from_static": true,
  "spawn": "initial",
  "synthetic": false,
  "aabb": {"min": [...], "max": [...]},
  "initial_pose": {"x": -3.74, "y": -0.82, "z": 0.49,
                   "qw": 1.0, "qx": 0.0, "qy": 0.0, "qz": 0.0},
  "visual_path": "entities/office_chair_001/visual.glb",
  "descriptor": {
    "entity_id": "office_chair_001",
    "kind": "dynamic",
    "shape_hint": "mesh",
    "extents": [],
    "mass": 8.0,
    "mesh_ref": "entities/office_chair_001/visual.glb"
  },
  "physics": {"shape": "mesh"},
  "visual": {}
}
```

`descriptor` is the runtime-facing subset (matches `EntityDescriptor`
on the wire); the rest is provenance for debuggability.

## Bundled scenes

| Scene name | Source | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `dimos-office` | `data/dimos_office_mesh/dimos_office_mesh.glb` | Default — office with 17 chairs, 1 printer, manip rig |
| `street-lite` | Sketchfab street scene | Outdoor nav |
| `lowpoly-tdm` | Sketchfab lowpoly map | Lightweight nav stress test |
| `mall-babylon-nolights` | Generated mall | Large indoor nav |

Aliases live in `dimos/simulation/scenes/catalog.py`. Add a new entry
to `_PACKAGE_DIRS` and `_ALIASES` if you cook a new scene you want
the rest of the stack to find by name.
