"""Flagship sim e2e: G1 explores a cooked scene package on command.

The full simulation standard in one test: G1 spawns in the office scene
package under the GR00T whole-body policy, the Rust scene lidar raycasts
the cooked collision GLB into the raytrace map → costmap → planner, the
textured mesh camera streams RGBD, and an MCP agent receives "explore
the space" and drives the frontier explorer. Asserts the sensor streams
are live, the explorer publishes goals, and the robot walks away from
spawn.

Wall time is dominated by scene compose + GR00T load (1-4 min) plus the
exploration budget; expect ~6-12 min.
