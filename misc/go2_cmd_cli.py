"""External CLI for sending joint targets to the Go2 wholebody coordinator.

Pair with ``unitree-go2-wholebody-coordinator`` running in another terminal.
This script publishes ``JointState`` to ``/go2/joint_command``; the
coordinator's servo task picks it up and drives motors via the
TransportWholeBodyAdapter → Go2WholeBodyConnection → rt/lowcmd chain.

Why external (not a Module): dimos worker processes don't reliably
attach stdin, so the embedded ``Go2JointCommanderModule`` could not
read terminal input. Running this script in your own shell sidesteps
that entirely.

Commands at the prompt:
    sync               read current actual joint positions and print
                       them. READ-ONLY - does not modify the local
                       target. Use this to observe where the robot
                       really is during/after motion (e.g. check how
                       well PD is tracking after `stand`).
    arm                publish the current local target ONCE
    show               print the current local target (no publish)
    bounds             print the per-joint envelope (sit ↔ stand + margin)
    stand              load 'standing' preset → publish
    sit                load 'sitting' preset → publish
    lerp <alpha>       linear interpolate between sit (0) and stand (1)
                       → publish. e.g. 'lerp 0.3' = 30% standing.
                       Useful for incremental crouch-to-stand testing.
    set <i> <q>        set joint i absolute, clamped → publish
    nudge <i> <dq>     add dq to joint i, clamped → publish
    pose <q0..q11>     full 12-value target, clamped → publish
    help               list commands
    quit               exit (does NOT relax motors — Ctrl-C the
                       coordinator to send the safe-stop LowCmd)

The 'standing' and 'sitting' presets are Unitree's official _targetPos_1
and _targetPos_2 from `example/go2/low_level/go2_stand_example.py` in
unitree_sdk2_python. These are the hand-tuned poses the Unitree firmware
uses for its own stand-up demo, so they're known-good on real Go2 hardware.
Envelope = [min(stand_i, sit_i) - margin, max(stand_i, sit_i) + margin]
per joint, with a default margin of 0.05 rad (~2.9°).
